Cold storage warehouses, facilities which utilise refrigeration or air-conditioning to preserve temperature- sensitive and perishable products, have emerged as one of the hottest asset classes attracting US$4.9 billion of investment in 2022. Although accounting for only 11.4% of the total industrial and logistics transaction volume in the region, this market has delivered a staggering 29.6% CAGR from 2017 to 2022, outperforming its peers. The cold storage business has witnessed a rise in demand due to a number of factors, including increasing household incomes, the rise of urban and middle-class populations, as well as some structural changes to consumer behaviour. As incomes have grown in the region, consumption preferences have shifted towards more perishable and higher-quality foods which have also driven consumers away from traditional wet markets towards supermarkets as well as the purchase of more frozen, processed, and pre-prepared products for convenience",
    "2": "and variety. These behavioural changes have translated into complementary demand for cold storage infrastructure. Another key contributing factor is the boom of e-commerce and online grocery sales, which were further accelerated by pandemic tailwinds as many turned to online shopping out of necessity during lockdowns. E-commerce penetration rates in markets such as mainland China (27%) and South Korea (27%) are now among the highest in the world, well above the global average of 22% in 2022. Meanwhile emerging markets, such as the ASEAN bloc, are experiencing rapid digitalisation among their youthful populations, their key consumer group. The ASEAN bloc is expected to see an estimated 17% CAGR in its e-commerce penetration rate between 2022 and 2026. All in all, e-commerce will account for about 29% of total retail sales in Asia by 2026, just slightly below the 30% average in North America. In addition, the pandemic has also spurred the storage need for vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and other healthcare products which require temperature-controlled cold chain logistics. Government support also plays a major role in the development of the sector, especially in countries with sizable agricultural industries.

Likewise, the Indian government has also invested heavily in the industry, as well as encouraging private participation through various subsidy schemes, such as the ‘Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana’ and the ‘Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture’ scheme, which both provide ﬁ nancial support in the form of grants-in-aid.

According to a report released by the Global Cold Chain Alliance (GCCA), in terms of total stock, India is the largest cold storage market in the world, with about 150 million cubic metres of space, with China (105 million) and Japan (38 million) taking third and fourth place. However, supply is still struggling to match demand. The per capita availability of cold storage space across major Asia Paciﬁ c markets varied from 0.03 cubic metres to 0.50 cubic metres in 2018. New Zealand leads the region with 0.50 cubic metres, followed by India (0.34) and Japan (0.32). However, apart from New Zealand, the regional average is signiﬁ",
    "4": "cantly lower than the average in the US and UK, which stands at 0.49 and 0.44 cubic metres respectively. The region would need another 325 million cubic metres to reach the average capacity of the US and UK, which is more than double the 2018 stock level based on GCCA’s estimates. Furthermore, much of the existing stock in the region is smaller in size and less automated compared with mature markets. For example, cold storage warehouses in India often range from 15,000 to 25,000 cubic metres per facility compared to over 100,000 cubic metres in developed economies such as Australia, the UK and the US. Therefore, apart from constructing new builds, renovation and retroﬁ tting of existing facilities is also needed to bridge the gap in the meantime. The adoption of automation, such as automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS) and goods-to- man picking set-ups, is entering the Asian cold storage market in a signiﬁ cant way. This can help to achieve the same storage capacity in a smaller building, reduce power usage and increase the productivity of warehouse operatives.

GLP is also planning to build 100 cold storage facilities across China by the end of 2025. However, as the margins available from logistics and industrial assets have narrowed substantially over the past few years, the quest for yield has prompted more investors to look at niche properties. The higher risk premium for cold storage is partly balanced by the tight vacancy, longer lease terms (cold storage leases tend to be twice as long as those for dry",

The positive sentiment is being priced in with yield compression noted even during the pandemic. On average, we see that prime cold storage warehouses oﬀ er 4.0% to 5.5% yields across major Asia Paciﬁ c markets, representing a 30 to 150 bps spread over dry warehouse margins. MAJOR MARKETS China The online grocery business is booming in China, with its market size projected to grow from RMB572.4 billion in 2021 to RMB1,210.4 billion in 2025, reﬂ ecting an 111% growth rate. In addition to fresh food products, there is also strong demand for ready-to-cook ingredients and pre-prepared dishes as people have less time to cook at home and restaurants aim to reduce costs by having some food preparation done oﬀ -site. CITIC Securities projects the market for pre-prepared dishes will reach about RMB1 trillion in the next ten years. As a result, more cold chain facilities are expanding capacity and adding production lines to store, process, and package food products. The demand for cold storage is estimated at around 300 million tonnes of food products per year, based on the annual output of the fruit, vegetables, meat, seafood, dairy, and frozen food sectors. This ﬁ gure is expected to rise to over 400 million tonnes in 2025, a growth of over 30%. In total, cold storage supply is falling short by 100 million tonnes per year versus demand. Rents for prime cold storage warehouses are about two to three times higher than for dry warehouses, ranging from RMB2.0 (Zhengzhou) to RMB5.5 (Shenzhen) per sq m per day across markets. Shenzhen tops the list at RMB5.5 per sq m per day, driven by tight supply dynamics, followed by Beijing and Guangzhou at RMB4.3 and RMB4.2 per sq m",

Automated facilities will also reduce operating costs for tenants, which ought to lead to higher rents. All in all, a structural shortfall is expected to persist in the industry beyond the short and medium term, which will translate into higher occupancy rates, stronger rental growth, and desirable investment opportunities. COLD STORAGE WAREHOUSES LURE INVESTORS WITH HIGHER YIELD POTENTIAL Cold storage warehouses entail higher capital and operational costs than regular dry warehouses due to their structural complexity, which also implies a longer turnover period. Health and safety concerns associated with the stored products also subject these warehouses to more regulations, making it diﬃ cult for new entrants to navigate the regulatory landscape and obtain the necessary permits. As a result, cold storage facilities are often highly customised and built-to-suit, which hinders the ability of new tenants to repurpose or retroﬁ t. Therefore, many players in this ﬁ eld are upstream retailers or third-party logistics operators with extensive know-how, whereas institutional investors often team up with cold chain operators, retroﬁ tting old dry warehouses. Direct acquisition opportunities are rare as there are typically only a limited number of mature properties on the market. As an example, experienced logistics and industrial property developers and operators like ESR and GLP manage several private equity funds which invest in cold GRAPH 7: China Cold Storage Operators by Market Share, 2022 VX, 9.0% Yupei, 4.1% Asia Cold, 3.3% Metcold, 3.2% Sinotrans, 2.0% Creaway, 1.6% GFS, 1.2% Others, 75.7% Source Savills Research & Consultancy GRAPH 6: China Cold and Dry Warehouse Rental Range by Market, 2022 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Cold Storage",

Yet prime cold storage facilities only account for 28% of total stock, with VX Logistics being the largest with a mere 9% share. Thus, we expect to see ample opportunities for consolidation and expansion of integrated cold chain networks going forward. Meanwhile, the continued rental growth for prime warehouses in ﬁ rst-tier cities will likely spur more retroﬁ tting of dry warehouses and new builds in neighbouring cities. On the investment side, logistics and cold chain assets have lost none of their allure as structural drivers, along with the low interest rate environment, remain compelling. Besides veteran investors such as GLP, ESR, and DNE, the market is also seeing new players enter the space including CapitaLand, Link REIT, NWS and Morgan Stanley. Competition for investment- grade cold chain facilities has increased, compressing yields to commercial property levels. INDIA India is one of the fastest growing countries for the cold chain industry. The cold storage market was valued at US$9.23 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.67% from 2022 to 2028 according to Mordor Intelligence, backed by the country’s large agricultural sector, booming pharmaceutical, and retail sectors, as well as the evolving lifestyles of consumers. At present, India is the world’s largest producer of milk, it’s second largest producer of fruit & vegetables, food grains and marine products and the ﬁ fth largest producer of meat and meat products. The Indian pharmaceutical industry is growing in leaps and bounds and is carving a niche for itself in the global pharma terrain. The Indian government has",

For example, the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has been implementing an umbrella scheme, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY), with an allocation of US$585 million for the period 2021-22 to 2025-26.

The high energy requirement for cold storage operations has also caused some cities to cap development under the 'dual carbon' policy. This has forced many investors to look at satellite cities nearby, and the spill-over demand will continue to drive up rents across larger metropolitan areas. The cold chain logistics market in China is highly competitive and fragmented, with operators often bound by their regionality. Nationwide operators like SF Express and JD Cold Chain often engage in both cold chain logistics and storage. The cold chain network is still heavily concentrated in eastern China, especially the Yangtze River region,",
    "9": "as well as the northern Beijing- Tianjin cluster, while the south lags behind. As a result, we have also seen more investors actively building and acquiring cold chain properties in the Greater Bay Area (GBA). For example, Blackstone acquired the Guangzhou International Airport R&F Integrated Logistics Park, the largest urban logistics park in the GBA, from R&F Group through two acquisitions in 2020 and 2021. The park has about 889,820 sq m of high quality leasable industrial space, and 140,000 sq m of undeveloped land area, upon which Blackstone is constructing additional cold storage facilities tailored for the food and pharmaceutical industries. We have also seen a number of operators and developers, including VX Logistics, Metcold, Asia Cold, Orange3, Creaway, Wanxin Cold Chain, and Global Freezer Services, rapidly expanding their cold storage networks across the country.

At the moment, the cold storage market in India is highly fragmented with over 3,000 players distributed unevenly across the country, with the majority of facilities located in the northern and western regions. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, the country had around 8,361 cold storage warehouses in 2022, and Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, and Punjab together accounted for 71% of the country’s total storage capacity. However, there has been a trend towards the development of cold storage facilities in other regions, including in the south and east. High initial and operating costs and a lack of adequate infrastructure remain major hurdles for this asset class.

On top of which, operating costs for the cold storage business in India are approximately US$8.0 to US$9.5 per pallet per month, compared to a US$3.0 average in western countries. Electricity expenses alone make up about 25% to 30% of total operating expenses compared to around 10% in the West. Lastly, choosing the right location is critical given the infrastructure gap, as is securing the necessary permits and approvals. These factors in combination set a high barrier to entry and largely limit investors to domestic veterans. The Indian cold chain market has continued to grow in recent years through enhanced eﬃ ciency, optimizing end-to-end logistical progress, providing one-stop-shop cold chain solutions, and taking advantage of the growing number of 3PL players. The trend towards outsourcing temperature- controlled logistics is expected to drive demand for end-to-end supply chain services in this sector. In addition to storage and distribution, cold chain operators are expected to oﬀ er value-added services to meet the evolving needs of the market. SOUTH KOREA South Korea boasts a well-developed cold storage market, supported primarily by its robust e-commerce and overnight delivery business, with frozen foods having emerged as one of the fastest-growing market segments.

VIETNAM Vietnam's growing middle class and thriving economy have bolstered the demand for high-quality food products. The country’s fresh food sales surged from US$40.4 billion in 2020 to US$45.7 billion in 2022, a CAGR of 6.3%. Strong domestic demand coupled with a booming e-commerce scene are primary catalysts for the country’s cold storage development. Vietnam's e-commerce market also witnessed a remarkable annualised growth rate of 21.5% from 2017 to 2022, fueling the expansion of all kinds of complimentary services. The online food delivery market is therefore also experiencing signiﬁ cant growth, with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2020 to 2022, driven by evolving consumer preferences and increasing e-commerce adoption. Similar to other emerging markets in the region, Vietnam’s cold storage landscape is localized and highly fragmented, with over 40 projects providing a total of 460,000 sq m of cold chain warehouse space in 2022.

The remaining markets, including Yeong-nam (24%), and Chung- cheong (3%) are still developing. In contrast to other APAC markets, where the logistics sector typically maintains more stable tenancies than oﬃ ce spaces, logistics leases in SMA are commonly more elastic except for a few large occupiers such as Coupang, Market Kurly and major parcel companies, some of which incur signiﬁ cant capex investments for automation. The average lease period for a logistics asset is about two years, which is shorter than the three-to-ﬁ ve-year lease term for prime oﬃ ce space and thus results in more volatility in the rental market. While varying largely by region, the average rent for cold storage warehouses in the SMA was KRW60,100 per pyeong per month in 2H/2022, nearly double the average of dry storage warehouses (KRW29,000 per pyeong per month) based on face rents, though the eﬀ ective rental gap is likely lower. Due to elevated new supply levels in recent years, cold storage landlords are giving more rent-free periods as an incentive to secure tenancies. For example, in the Incheon region, lease terms vary signiﬁ cantly, with one centre reported to be marketing up to four rent-free months per lease year, a substantial discount from the standard one to two-month practice.
