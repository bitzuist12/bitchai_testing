The quest for yield that in recent years drove global institutions into logistics assets is pushing them increasingly into more specialised warehouse space—particularly cold storage. Challenges to delivering perishable vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic and, more recently, food shortages have underscored the importance of large, reliable refrigerated facilities. Demand for cold storage is growing most rapidly in Asia Pacific, driven by evolving appetites among the region’s expanding middle class and a shift to online grocery and meal deliveries or e-groceries. Key themes include: The global cold supply chain market is expected to grow by a CAGR of 7% to USD 411 billion in 2028, from USD 256 billion in 2021. Asia Pacific’s cold storage market is largely fragmented, outdated and due for replacement. Asia Pacific’s demand for cold storage is likely to grow by at least 20% annually over the next three years, led by Australia, China, and India. Investment in Asia Pacific cold storage could quintuple over the next decade to USD 4-5 billion. Growth is propelled by rising demand from Asia Pacific’s expanding middle class and double-digit growth in e-groceries and other forms of e-commerce. The wider cold-chain market in Asia Pacific is expected to grow at a 12% CAGR from 2021-2028. Cold-storage investment lags 3-4 years behind supply of dry warehouses, where record deals have doubled stock in five years, resulting in sharp yield compression. Asia Pacific has a shortage of cold storage. Filling the gap would require 500 million cubic meters of new space and double current supply.

    "3": "investors shopping for yield from global logistics assets have in recent years enjoyed rising prices but diminishing returns. In response, they’re pivoting toward more specialised warehouse assets, including the burgeoning market for cold storage facilities. In October 2020, at the height of the pandemic, Americold paid Oaktree USD 1.74 billion for Agro Merchants Group, the world’s fourth-largest cold storage operator, adding 46 facilities to its global cold storage portfolio. In May this year, Bain Capital and Barber Partners announced a USD 500 million partnership to develop next-generation cold storage warehouses across the United States.1 Interest in cold storage is also growing in Asia Pacific. Hines is developing several cold storage projects in the region, and bought completed facilities in Dongguan, China, in 2020 and another in Seoul earlier this year.2 Blackrock and Metropolitan Real Estate last year entered China’s cold storage sector, investing in Metcold’s Opportunity Funds I and II. CapitaLand Investment and PGIM Real Estate in March paid USD 74 million for a cold storage facility in Gwangju, South Korea.3 And in May, Heitman acquired a 100,000 sq. ft. Hong Kong logistics asset to repurpose into a cold storage logistics facility.4 1“Bain Capital, Barber Team Up on $500 Million Plan for Cold-Storage Warehouses,” Wall Street Journal, May 3, 2022. 2“Hines developing second cold chain warehouse in South Korea,” Mingtiandi, Jan. 10, 2022; and “Hines teams with Carlyle fund manager to buy Guangdong cold chain project,” Mingtiandi, Nov. 18, 2020 3“CapitaLand Investment launches value-add logistics fund in South Korea to grow funds under management,” PR Newswire, March 22, 2022 4“Heitman Acquires Hong Kong Industrial Asset for Cold Storage Logistics,” Heitman.com, May 3, 2022.

Consequently, its pool of cold-storage assets lacks the diversity of the general logistics and industrial sector. Likewise, fewer investors have entered the sector, so liquidity is also lower. Barriers to entry in cold storage, conversely, remain comparatively high. Because cold storage warehouses are usually highly customized and subject to several layers of regulation, they can cost two to three times what a dry warehouse does to build and take several months longer. Cold-storage warehouses typically require specially insulated metal panels, premium concrete, under-floor heating, and refrigeration equipment to keep contents between certain temperatures. This equipment also requires more costly regular maintenance. Facility operators must comply with local and national regulations governing building and worker safety, as well as safety and storage of foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals. These add cost and complexity to operating cold storage facilities, which deters many investors. Asia Pacific’s cold storage market has lagged general warehouse investment As a result, investment in Asia Pacific cold storage has lagged that of general warehouses. The investment volume totalled roughly USD 1 billion in 2021, just 4.3% of conventional warehouse sales the same year, according to MSCI Real Capital Analytics (RCA). But as investor pools deepen and structural tailwinds emerge for the sector, we expect the cold storage investible universe to grow expediently.

The rush to meet Asia Pacific’s growing cold storage needs | 7 Higher spreads and attractive leasing terms are luring investors to Asia Pacific cold storage Lower liquidity and higher costs have translated into higher risk premiums for cold storage assets. Those premiums are now attracting investors as yields in general logistics and the wider industrial sector fall. Cold storage’s higher risks are also offset in many cases by the sector’s benefits, including higher rental premiums, higher occupancy rates, and longer weighted average lease expiries—as well as fixed rental escalation and triple net lease agreements. While increased investment in cold storage assets has been pushing spreads down, cold storage yields in the U.S. remain more than 30bps higher on average than general warehouse yields. Spreads are even higher in Asia Pacific’s less-developed markets, ranging from 30bps in Shanghai to as high as 80bps in Tokyo.

Demand for cold storage is underpinned by a combination of fundamental drivers, including real household incomes and consumption, which are cyclical, as well as population growth, which is not. Cold storage has three main groups of customers: food and beverage wholesalers, e-grocers, and pharmaceutical companies. Economic vagaries may affect the composition and quality of the products customers buy, but the products themselves are nondiscretionary. Demand for cold storage is thus somewhat inelastic and less tightly correlated with economic trends. The shift to e-groceries, fed by the",
    "7": "pandemic, is fuelling cold storage’s growth Food price inflation and looming shortages since Russia’s invasion in February of Ukraine have only underscored the importance of cold-supply chains in securing supplies of perishable food. Before that, the pandemic highlighted the need for expanded cold-storage supply chains to meet the stringent temperature requirements for storing and transporting vital medicine. The pandemic’s lockdowns and social-distancing requirements also accelerated a shift among consumers to e-groceries. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, as many as 80% of U.S. shoppers bought groceries online,5 straining existing cold storage facilities and creating new opportunities for third-party operators. Even as pandemic restrictions were lifted, online sales have continued to grow, suggesting the shift in consumer habits will outlast the pandemic. 5“Nearly 80% of U.S. consumers shopped online for groceries since COVID-19 outbreak,” Supermarket News, May 27, 2020 The rush to meet Asia Pacific’s growing cold storage needs | 11 Rising incomes and urbanization are accelerating these shifts in Asia Pacific These global trends are even more pronounced in Asia Pacific, where they have been intensified and accelerated by more rapid household income growth, expanding cross-border trade in perishable food and a lower level of regional market development. Rapid urbanization and a burgeoning middle class are fuelling demand among Asia Pacific consumers for a more varied range of perishable foodstuffs that must be chilled or frozen before being shipped and stored ahead of distribution, purchase, and consumption. Even as aggregate demand grows, moreover, Asia Pacific is also seeing a shift away from brick-and-mortar, resulting in double-digit growth in e-commerce and e-grocery sales. Over the past several years, Asia Pacific grade A logistics stock has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. Demand for cold storage facilities is now strongest in Australia, China, and India, according",
    "8": "to JLL’s Future of Global Logistics Real Estate survey. Since the pandemic, Southeast Asia has added 70 million online shoppers. While China’s online retail market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% between 2020 and 2025, India’s is projected to grow at almost 13% and Indonesia’s at more than 14%. Growing affluence is likewise driving demand for better healthcare, requiring pharmaceuticals that like fresh food are perishable. With Asia Pacific’s youngest, fastest-growing populations in tropical nations—including India, Indonesia, and the Philippines—the need for cold storage is clear. The rush to meet Asia Pacific’s growing cold storage needs | 12 Asia Pacific already has an acute shortage of cold storage facilities Asia Pacific already faces a profound shortage of cold storage capacity. Just filling the existing gap would mean adding almost 500 million cubic meters of new supply—more than double the existing cold storage stock. And due to its high energy consumption to power industrial refrigeration, existing facilities face increased pressure to retrofit with greener features. From simply buying electricity through renewable sources, to installing solar panels and implementing IOT technology for auto temperature adjustment, all in the name of meeting net zero carbon targets.

These problems are even more severe in Asia Pacific, where a greater proportion of the region’s cold chain market is run by small-",
    "9": "and medium-sized operators that lack scale and therefore efficiency. This fragmentation is reflected in the weak standing of many Asia Pacific countries in the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index. Obsolescence in Asia Pacific is so widespread that as much as a third of new supply in recent years has been created by upgrading, replacing, or consolidating existing stock. We estimate between 10-15% of existing, grade A cold storage stock still needs replacement. For existing warehouses run by 3PL (third-party logistics), what we see is operators requiring the tenant to cover the full retrofit cost. This means new investment is needed not only to meet Asia Pacific’s new demand, but also to accommodate customers that need to replace their current facilities.

They remain relatively under allocated to Asia Pacific logistics and residential assets.

Similar reallocations are accelerating logistics investment in Asia Pacific This shift is also underway in Asia Pacific. We expect logistics investment to expand from just 16% of regional portfolio allocations to roughly 30%. Last year, we predicted that investment in Asia Pacific logistics and industrial assets would double by 2025, to USD 50-60 billion, from USD 25-30 billion in 2019-2020. This target was almost reached by the end of that year, when",
    "11": "investment topped USD 48 billion. If current growth rates are sustained, investment in Asia Pacific logistics and industrial assets will soon exceed USD 60 billion. Cold storage is likely to become a distinct asset class as it grows The return performance of the conventional warehouse segment makes a compelling case for the cold storage market. Figure 1 illustrates how closely the pair tracks one another, keeping in mind investment in cold storage remains roughly 3-4 years behind that of general warehouses. The continued level of new supply for Asia Pacific’s general warehouse has contributed to record levels of deal activity in the sector since 2018. Grade A warehouse stock has nearly doubled over the last five years, yet cold storage supply remained stagnant until recently. The experience of Japan and South Korea offers insight into the future for Asia Pacific cold storage. Both countries accounted for nearly half of the region’s total investment in general warehouses over the past three years. As supplies in the two countries climbed, deal activity rose sharply, and yield compression subsequently followed, creating a positive feedback loop. We expect the same pattern to be repeated in the region’s cold storage sector over the next several years.

We estimate cold storge deals to make up nearly 10% of the logistics investment volume, given we expect cold storage stock to account for between 10-15% of overall logistics stock. Investment in Asia Pacific’s cold storage market could quintuple over the next decade,9 to at least USD 4-5 billion, with the region’s cold chain market growing at a 12% CAGR between 2021 and 2028. These estimates may prove conservative: In our Future of Global Logistics Real Estate survey last year, 91% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that cold storage demand in Asia Pacific would rise over the next three years by more than 20%. As investors seeking alternative assets turn to cold storage and the sector is established as a critical link in global supply chains, we foresee it becoming a distinct asset class requiring its own portfolio allocation.10 Figure 9: The cold chain logistics market by region from 2020 to 2024 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 USD Billions North America APAC Europe Source: Statista 9Asia Pacific Capital Tracker 1Q22, p. 19. 10The Future of Global Logistics Real Estate, 2021 © 2022 All rights reserved.
