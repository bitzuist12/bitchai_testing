The primary data source was a survey administered by GCCA staff in Spring 2018. In addition, official government reports were sources for information on the United States (U.S. Department of Agriculture) and India (India Ministry of Food Processing Industries). Summary of the Findings The total capacity of refrigerated warehouses worldwide was 616 million cubic meters in 2018, 2.67% greater than",
    "3": "the capacity reported in 2016. India was the single largest country market, at 150 million cubic meters, followed by the United States at 131 million cubic meters, and China at 105 million cubic meters. Refrigerated warehouse space was distributed unevenly across countries based on the index of market penetration developed by the Global Cold Chain Alliance (GCCA). The market development index is calculated as cold storage capacity per urban resident. The urban population is used in this benchmark because it is expected that urban centers are where the middle-class income population is concentrated. In developing country markets, the middle-class and high-income consumer segments support the demand for refrigerated and frozen foods, which ultimately drives the refrigerated warehouse service industry. Refrigerated warehouses serve various needs in the food logistics process: storage of seasonally produced foods to allow them to be available year-round, short-term storage staged in strategic locations to meet retail distribution needs, and import-export logistics facilities along global transportation routes. There are two classifications of business models: warehouses available to multiple users on a for-hire basis and those operated by a food company exclusively for the company’s sole use. In this report, as in industry practice, the warehouses available for-hire on a third-party basis are referred to as “public” refrigerated warehouses, although most of them are privately owned businesses. The term “private” warehouse is reserved for those warehouses operated by a food company exclusively for that company’s use. Limitations and Methodological Notes The figures in this report are the most complete data available to document the global refrigerated warehouse industries. Certain limitations should be noted due to variations in units of measure and in defining the scope of the industry. Units of measure. This report contains the potential for statistical error due to the required application of quantitative conversion factors.",
    "4": "Most of the respondents to this survey collect information in cubic meters, which is the standard capacity unit adopted by the Global Cold Chain Alliance. Therefore, most of the units of measure are consistent throughout the report. However, a few nations customarily report in pallets, which presents a complication because the size of a standard pallet differs for European and American markets (see the Appendix for the applied conversion factors). Some responses were received in metric tonnage units. Tonnage units were converted to cubic meters on the basis of an assumption provided by food industry experts about the type of product stored. Scope of the industry as a limitation on the data. Warehouses that do business with a number of customers are known as public refrigerated warehouse (PRWs) and are a part of the third-party logistics (3PL) business. The Global Cold Chain Alliance is a trade association of PRWs and therefore sources large amounts of information from the PRW industry. Warehouses that were operated privately may not have 4 been thoroughly covered by the information sources affiliated with the GCCA. For example, the data collected for Mexico over the past 10 years have included only the public for-hire warehousing capacity. In 2018, the total Mexican market size was notably substantially higher because privately operated space was included in the estimate for the first time. Some national government agencies collect information on public, for-hire warehouses as well as privately operated space. Regardless of the source of information, every effort has been made to obtain a size estimate inclusive of both public space and private space, and to break out the market shares of the two types of business. The definition of the industry used by some government statistics agencies also contributes to possible inconsistency in scope of the data. For example,",
    "5": "the government of India reported on warehouse space used for vegetable and fruit products and therefore the national estimate may not include warehousing used for meat, dairy, and processed foods. In the United States, the national survey program targets those warehouses that typically store foods for more than one month. As a result, the estimate of the privately- operated warehouse space in the United States likely is understated because it does not include distribution centers used for storage over periods of less than one month. Largest Country Markets India has reported 150 million cubic meters of refrigerated warehousing in 2018, maintaining the position of the largest total capacity among the countries in the GCCA database. India had 7,645 cold storages in 2018, each averaging less than 20,000 cubic meters in size. Nearly all of the cold storage facilities were owned by private sector companies and the products stored were mainly potatoes and other vegetables. The United States, with 131 million cubic meters of refrigerated warehouse capacity, was ranked second behind India. Refrigerated facilities in the United States averaged approximately 113,000 cubic meters each. China was the third-ranked country market in 2018, at 105 million cubic meters. After several years of rapid expansion, growth in the Chinese refrigerated warehouse industry has leveled off, according to industry sources. The country-by-country capacity data for 2018 and 2016 (most recent year available) are shown in Figure 1 for the top 20 countries.

To facilitate comparisons across countries, a market development index was calculated. The metric for service levels relative to the needs in the market is defined as cubic meters per population in urban areas. Table 1 contains",
    "8": "the total market size and the market development index (MDI) for the 60 countries that reported to the GCCA in either 2018 or 2016. As expected, many of the higher-income countries had higher presence of refrigerated warehousing capacity, relative to the urban population. Per-capita market penetration in the better-served markets typically ranged from 0.3 cubic meters to 0.5 cubic meters per urban resident (Figure 2). The highest market index levels were in New Zealand (0.5), the United States (0.49), and Great Britain (0.44). Among the developing countries, Uzbekistan and Mauritius reported the highest levels of market penetration with 0.38 and 0.43 cubic meters, respectively, of refrigerated storage per urban resident. Canada and Japan were at 0.31 cubic meters per urban resident. India demonstrated continued progress in terms of cold storage capacity relative to urban population. The market development index for India rose to 0.34 in 2018, an improvement from 0.33 in 2016 and 0.30 in 2010. It should be noted that India’s population is less urbanized than that of China, Brazil, and other emerging market economies. Later in this report, the state-by-state location of India’s refrigerated warehouses is provided. The middle-ranked countries in terms of refrigerated warehousing per urban population include the emerging market economies of Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, and China (Figure 3). The market development index levels for the mid-ranked countries ranged from 0.08 to 0.24 cubic meters of refrigerated warehouse capacity per urban resident. Based on these index levels, there is considerable unmet need in these markets. Brazil reported the addition of 3 million cubic meters since 2016 (4.3% annualized rate of growth) in spite of its economic crisis. Later in this report, the state-by-state location of Brazil’s refrigerated warehouses is provided. In Mexico, GCCA sources reported a modest increase in the public for-hire warehousing capacity. The total",
    "9": "market size in Mexico in 2018, at 15 million cubic meters, was significantly larger than in 2016 because privately operated space was included. The major change for Mexico was due to recording of privately operated space that was not disclosed in past reports. The group of countries that have low refrigerated capacity, relative to potential needs, are at less than .05 cubic meters per urban resident (Figure 4). Several of these countries have predominantly low-income households and modest presence of modern grocery retail infrastructure. 9 Figure 2: Refrigerated Warehouse Market Development Index (Capacity in Cubic Meters per Urban Resident), for Countries in the High Range of the Index, 2016 or 2018.

Food markets are dynamic and naturally vary around the world. A summary indicator 12 of the 5-year trend in food demand by country is provided in Table 4. The compound annual growth rate was calculated as: 𝐶𝐴𝐺𝑅 = [( 2017 2012 ) 1 5 − 1]. The figures are based on grocery retail sales value in nominal terms, in local currency (Euromonitor), which is illustrative of food markets in most respects. However, it should be noted that price changes and the composition of the food basket might drive growth in retail sales without a corresponding change in demand for storage. For example, consumers might choose different quality levels, such as expensive meat cuts, over a cheaper item, thus increasing retail sales value without a change in storage space. Or, inflation and related macroeconomic shocks can explain extremely high growth rates such as those shown for Venezuela and Argentina",

Population growth slowed over in the 2012-2016 period, as shown in the bars in Figure 5, scaled on the left axis. Consumers' incomes in India grew, as marked by the line in Figure 5 (right axis scale). However, inflation has overtaken much of this nominal increase in personal expenditures. In its forecasts published in March 2018, Euromonitor had a positive outlook for India. Overall economic growth was predicted to be 12% CAGR over 2016-2021. The retail market growth forecast is the same, at 12% annually for 2016-2021. This expectation is slightly above the annualized rate of grocery retail sales that occurred during 2012-2017 (Table 4). Inadequate roadway and warehouse infrastructure will be barriers to more rapid expansion of the freight transportation sector, including food distribution, according to Euromonitor. In 2016-2017, the Indian government invested in roadway infrastructure and built 8,231 kilometers of new highways. An additional 14 billion US dollars for road construction was allocated for 2017-2018 (Euromonitor).

The survey coverage changed to include only those facilities in the United States that store product for 4 weeks. As a result of this change, there is a discontinuity in the U.S. industry capacity figures relative to prior years. In order to provide consistency across years to the extent possible, the data for the United States presented in this report were obtained largely from GCCA sources. The GCCA estimates cover public, for-hire warehouses regardless of the duration of product storage. The GCCA does not have an estimate for privately-operated warehouses and therefore the U.S. Department of Agriculture figures were used to represent privately-operated facilities. It should be noted that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had substantially fewer privately-operated warehouses reporting under the survey program in 2017 compared with 2015. Consolidation of the U.S. industry into larger facilities continued in 2017, as it had in previous years (Table 7). The average size of a public, for-hire refrigerated warehouse in the United States was 113,487 cubic meters (approximately 5 million cubic feet). The number of U.S. refrigerated warehouses that were 5 million cubic feet or larger was nearly unchanged while a number of smaller warehouses dropped out of the national survey program.

Source: US Department of Agriculture based on survey conducted October 1, 2017. Conclusions Globally, cold storage capacity reached 616 million cubic meters in 2018, an increase of 2.7% since 2016. The three largest country markets—India, the United States, and China— accounted for 60% of the global total of refrigerated space. Total refrigerated warehouse capacity was compared with urban population to obtain a market development index that sheds light on the extent of unmet needs in a particular country. On average, there are approximately 0.2 cubic meters of refrigerated warehousing space per urban resident globally. Variation in the market development index across countries was significant, as a result of differences in consumers’ buying power in the countries as well as differences in food production and trading patterns. Based on the findings for 2018, Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, and China had the largest unmet need for refrigerated warehouse space. Sizes of refrigerated warehouses ranged from over 100,000 cubic meters in developed economies to 15,000- 25,000 per facility in emerging market and lower-income economies. There may be corresponding differences in occupancy or inventory turnover rates that result in small facilities potentially generating services and income comparable to larger facilities. A number of smaller warehouses located across food production areas might also be used to serve farmers and food security needs in food production areas where transportation links are limited. 25 References ABIAF (Associação Brasileira da Indústria de",

The conversion from weight-based units (metric tons) to volume units (cubic meters) depends on the product in storage, and we lack specific information on products for many countries. As a result, approximations of capacity in volume were made for certain countries. The conversions that were used in this report are: 1 Pallet = 6.65 cubic meters, for countries in the Americas. European pallets are converted at 1 Pallet = 1.944 cubic meters. 1 Metric ton = 4.3 cubic meters 1 Cubic meter = 35.31 cubic feet"
