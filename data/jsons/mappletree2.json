SINGAPORE MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Singapore’s economy expanded by 7.6% year-on-year (“y-o-y”) in 2021, a strong rebound from the 4.1% contraction in 2020. While the services-producing industries grew by 5.6% y-o-y in 2021, overall economic growth was led by the recovery of 13.4% y-o-y in the goods-producing industries. Alongside a robust expansion of 20.1% y-o-y for the construction sector, manufacturing grew significantly by 13.2% y-o-y. Singapore’s economic growth in 2022 is projected to slow as the base effect fades. Nonetheless, private consumption is expected to drive economic growth alongside the easing of domestic safe management measures and border restrictions. Against this backdrop, Singapore’s economy is forecasted to expand by 3.0% to 5.0% in 2022, barring an escalation in Russia-Ukraine conflict and a deterioration of the COVID-19 situation. While the immediate impact on the local economy has been manageable, the longer-term impact of the conflict on Singapore’s economy will depend on how the crisis unfolds.

New Initiative to Keep Supply Chains Agile The government launched an S$18 million Supply Chain 4.0 Initiative to help Singapore diversify its supply chains. The initiative aims to integrate more technology to assist Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to develop digital and automation solutions, as well as use technology to make supply chains more resilient and secure. This is expected to drive the demand for high-specification warehouse facilities in Singapore. SINGAPORE WAREHOUSE MARKET Existing Stock As of Q1/2022, there was 121.5 million sq ft of warehouse space in Singapore, of which 97% was held by the private sector and 3% by the public sector. Net supply in 2021 amounted to 3.1 million sq ft, significantly higher than that in 2020 (1.0 million sq ft) as construction delays resulting from COVID-19 pushed back the completion of several warehouse projects. Some of the major completions in 2021 include Cogent Jurong Island Logistics Hub (GFA: 942,000 sq ft), additions/alterations to Logos Tuas Logistics Hub (GFA: 863,000 sq ft) and additions/ alterations to warehouse development",

In Q1/2022, warehouse supply contracted by 800,000 sq ft despite some new completions such as Star International at Sungei Kadut (GFA: 205,000 sq ft). Potential Supply Based on Savills estimation, there is around 7.0 million sq ft Net Lettable Area (NLA) of warehouse space2 in the pipeline until 2024 (Figure 1). With construction delays expected to persist as the pandemic continues to weigh on manpower supply, part of the pipeline supply that was originally expected to complete in 2021 was rescheduled to 2022. About 4.9 million sq ft of warehouse space is estimated to come on stream in the next three quarters of 2022, followed by another 2.0 million sq ft in 2023 and 200,000 sq ft in 2024. This translates to an average new supply of 1.8 million sq ft for the next four years (2022 to 2025), which is lower than the four-year average historical completion of 2.7 million sq ft (2018 to 2021) (Table 1).

Compared with 2020 when leasing demand was largely driven by shorter leases to accommodate the surge in stockpiling, demand was more stable in 2021 as more industrialists committed to longer leases amid improving business sentiment. While part of the demand came from lease renewals by existing ecommerce players, some third-party logistics (3PL) companies expanded their warehouse network to support growing demand for domestic and international delivery amid the accelerated adoption of ecommerce. For instance, J&T Express opened a new warehouse at Changi Airfreight Centre to manage their international delivery and a new fulfilment centre at Penjuru to meet the rise in demand for ecommerce fulfilment and warehousing solutions. Demand was also driven by some industrialists which have successfully upscaled and internalised their own distribution and warehousing operations (and subsequently expanded or relocated to a larger facility). Furthermore, the rapid adoption of digital supply chain solutions also propelled demand for modern warehouse developments, with more industrialists relocating from older warehouses to newer or ramp-up warehouse facilities. This contributed to the healthy take-up in the West Planning Region, with larger firms taking up significant space in Tuas due to a lack of ready-built ramp-up facilities in other parts of Singapore. Although occupancy rate for warehouse space inched down to 90.3% in Q1/2022 due to a slight decline in occupier demand in the West Planning Region, it remains within the higher range in the last five years. Rents Rents continued to trend up on the back of strong demand for modern warehouse facilities amid limited supply of high-quality ready-built warehouses. Savills average monthly rent for prime warehouse and logistics properties4 rose at a faster pace by 2.1% YoY to S$1.46 per sq ft in Q4/2021, compared with 1.6% YoY in Q4/2020 (Figure 3). On",

This further reflects how the market is currently led by the flight to quality for modern warehouse space. While JTC’s warehouse rental index continued to rise (1.5% QoQ) in Q1/2022, Savills average monthly rent for prime warehouse and logistics properties recorded a marginal decline (-0.7% QoQ). It was largely due to the rental decline for some of the strata- titled warehouse properties in the basket of properties, which accounts for a relatively small proportion of overall stock.

After stagnating in the preceding year, sales volume increased by 75.0% YoY to 112 transactions in 2021, the highest since 2013. The increase was likely backed by local SMEs which acquired warehouse properties for their own business operations. There was a notable increase in demand from companies involved in ecommerce and last mile transportation services. Median unit prices of strata-titled warehouses reversed a two-year decline with an increase of 10.5% YoY to S$581 per sq ft in 2021, surpassing the price level in 2018. In Q1/2022, median unit prices continued to increase to S$619 per sq ft, up by 6.5% from 2021, backed by ample liquidity in the market (Figure 4). Major Investment Sales Warehouse transactions exceeding S$10 million amounted to S$379.0 million in 2021, 45.7% higher than the S$260.1 million transacted in 2020. Logistics assets have been in favour since the COVID-19 outbreak due to the heightened demand for storage space and last-mile logistics services amid the rapid adoption of ecommerce. The largest transaction in 2021 was Global Trade Logistics Centre at 46A Tanjong Penjuru which was acquired by ESR REIT for S$112.0 million.

In the face of operational constraints amid the pandemic, many businesses intensified their efforts to embrace advanced manufacturing, adopt new technology and upskill their workforce. Some initiatives to address the accelerated structural shifts resulting from COVID-19 include the digitalisation of warehousing operations and automation of production lines to cope with fluctuations in demand. As the pandemic quickened the pace of Industry 4.0. transformation, there is a greater shift of demand from traditional storage warehouses to high-specification warehouses with ramp-up facilities, last mile delivery/urban logistics and temperature-controlled facilities. This is fuelled by manufacturers gearing up for a post-pandemic future where supply chains will have to be increasingly nimble.

Some of the upcoming modern warehouse developments saw healthy pre-commitment levels. For instance, 2 Pioneer Sector 1 (2PS1) is already more than 50% pre-committed with tenants from Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), ecommerce and 3PL industries. Amid the pivot to Industry 4.0, landlords of older developments are likely to take the opportunity to embark on asset enhancement initiatives and redevelopment works to remain relevant. Nonetheless, owing to construction delays, the supply of modern warehouse facilities with quality specifications is expected to remain limited in the near term. Meanwhile, the protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine is expected to hit most of the external-oriented sectors in Singapore. As they are major commodity exporters, the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war has strained global supply chains and led to price increase for essential commodities such as oil, gas and industrial metals, which could potentially affect the manufacturing sector. Coupled with rising labour costs, elevated commodity prices are expected to result to higher business costs, which could curtail manufacturing activities. As a result, industrialists are likely to hold back on their expansion plans in the near term. Compared with other asset classes, warehouse and logistics real estate is expected to better weather the increased downside risks and negative feedback effects arising from",
    "9": "the Russia-Ukraine crisis, as well as rising interest rates. As such, rent for prime warehouse properties is forecasted to grow by up to 10% over the next two years, with the demand for warehouse facilities by new economy industries likely to stay firm. Rents are primed for continued growth, underpinned by the influx of more well-specified warehouse facilities which are able to command higher rents. Similarly, capital values for modern warehouse assets are expected to continue to rise in 2022. While investor demand for modern warehouse facilities remains robust, the availability of investable institutional-grade stock is likely to remain limited in the near term. In particular, sellers are expected to hold out for further upside as industrial and logistics remain as highly sought-after real estate assets.

As per the most recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the Australian economy expanded by 4.2% in the 12 months to the end of the December 2021. The recent outbreak of the Omicron COVID-19 strain of the virus across Australia poses a potential headwind to the momentum of the economic recovery looking ahead to 2022. However, despite the uncertainty, the national labor market remains strong. Total national",
    "11": "employment totals 13.4 million people as of March 2022 (ABS). This is 3.0% above the pre-COVID peak recorded in February 2020 and has resulted in unemployment falling to 4.0% - the lowest level since August 2008. As a result of a range of factors, particularly the tight global labor market, rising energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks, there is increasing concern about the potential short-term outlook for inflation. As such, most local bond yield forecasts have been revised and the decompression cycle will likely commence sooner than was originally expected. However, it is currently expected that the softening of bond yields will be relatively limited, and rates will remain relatively low over the long term in comparison to historical benchmarks. In its most recent release (March 2022), the Reserve Bank of Australia noted: Inflation has picked up more quickly than the RBA had expected, but remains lower than in many other countries (headline 3.5%). GDP growth is forecast to be 4.25% in 2022 and trend down slightly to 2.0% in 2023. The board remains committed to maintaining its accommodative monetary policy until inflation is sustainably within its target range of 2-3%, While inflation has picked up, it is too early to conclude that it is sustainably within the target range. INDUSTRIAL AND LOGISTICS SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS The Australian industrial & logistics sector has remained the most resilient out of the core commercial markets throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant structural tailwinds, many directly because of the pandemic, have supported significant tenant expansion across all tracked markets, which resulted in gross take-up in 2021 to reach a record high of 4.40 million sqm (previous record 2.9 million sqm). This has, in turn, resulted in elevated rental growth rates and record- high investment volumes (Figure 1). One of the major shifts resulting",
    "12": "from the pandemic has been the rapid acceleration in the adoption of eCommerce in Australia. Based on data released by the National Australia Bank, online sales accounted for 9.3% of retail activity as of January 2020. Since then, online shopping has become an increasingly important part of the broader retail landscape, accounting for 14.7% of total retail sales in 12 months to February 2022, which is approximately 17.4% higher than the 12 months to February 2021. This growth has had a material impact on industrial & logistics demand in Australia, as retailers and third-party logistics providers have been forced to increase their supply chain investment to improve delivery capacity to residential areas. This has resulted in a significant uptick in gross take-up from the Retail Trade & Transport, Postal and Warehousing sectors – having accounted for 2.3 million sqm gross take-up nationally in 2021 (10-year average – 1.4 million sqm). Based on current projections, it is expected that the online penetration rate in Australia will reach 20% by 2025, which will continue to underpin significant growth in the industrial occupier take-up from the Retail Trade & Transport, Postal and Warehousing sectors (Figure 2). The trend of re-shaping supply chains across the country has extended beyond the eCommerce boom. There have been significant disruptions to supply shipping networks across the world, which have driven up costs and caused major interruptions to a range of industries.

Container costs are still high but have started to recede from this peak, down by 12% to USD 9,806 in Jan 2022. Supply chain disruptions and increased costs are forcing occupiers to radically re-think their thinking on supply chains – increasing the prioritization of resilience. This is proving to have a positive flow-on effect for third-party logistics providers (3PLs) which are rapidly growing in the face of a significant increase in the amount of supply chain and logistics outsourcing that has occurred in Australia over the past 12-18 months.

This had its most severe impact across Q3, when both cities were in the peak of their lockdowns, which heavily impacted completion totals in the back half of the year (Figure 3). As a result of the record level of occupier activity over the last 12 months and the relatively subdued volumes of new development completions over the same period, there has been very little speculative stock delivered across the national market. In total, only 286,220 sqm of non-committed space was delivered over 2021, a significant decline from the previous year (461,470 sqm). A total of 3,049,450 sqm of new stock is due to complete over 2022 across the country, 533,080 sqm of which has already been delivered in 1Q22.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, The PRC reported a real GDP growth of 8.1% year-on-year (“YOY”) in 2021, with real GDP growth slowing from 4.9% YOY in 2021Q3 to 4.0% YOY in 2021Q4. Despite complications from the COVID-19 Omicron variant, real GDP growth in The PRC increased to 4.8% YOY in 2022Q1; however, a significant drop remains when compared to the 18.3% YOY growth in 2021Q1. Amid the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some cities and the emergence of new variants, The PRC has implemented strict epidemic control alongside a series of policies, including monetary loosening and dual-circulation strategies to boost the economy. With increasing vaccination rates, The PRC will continue to recover from the lingering effects of the global pandemic throughout 2022. Total imports and exports grew by 21.4% YOY in 2021 and 10.7% YOY in 2022Q1 while trade surplus recorded an expansion of 20.2% YOY in 2021 and 46.1% YOY in 2022Q1. Trade volume between The PRC and the US surged by 20.2% YOY in 2021 after the signing of the phase one agreement of the US-China trade dispute. In addition, import and export destinations of The PRC continued to diversify, with trade volumes of The PRC and the European Union and Association of Southeast Asian Nations increasing by 19.1% YOY and 19.7% YOY respectively in 2021",
    "27": "and 10.2% YOY and 8.4% YOY respectively in 2022Q1. While trade remains strong, there are significant risks to be considered, including rising freight costs and material prices, disruptions to the supply chain, and the appreciation of the Renminbi. Foreign direct investment (“FDI”) and outbound direct investment (“ODI”) of The PRC continued to expand in 2021, where FDI was 22.7% higher than the ODI, indicating that foreign investments in The PRC outstripped capital outflow in spite of the US-China trade dispute and COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Ministry of Commerce, FDI into The PRC surged 25.6% YOY in 2022Q1. In pursuit of sustainable long-term economic growth, The PRC’s economic rebalancing in recent years has led to a shift from an export-led to a domestic-driven economy. As a result, domestic consumption has become a key growth engine for the country. In 2021, domestic consumption accounted for 65.4% of The PRC’s economic growth and continues to be the major driving force of economic growth for the eighth consecutive year. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, cities were placed under lockdown and the operation of most physical retail stores were suspended. As a result, it accelerated the growing trend of online shopping. Online retail sales rose by 14.1% YOY in 2021 and 6.6% YOY in 2022Q1, outpacing the 12.5% YOY increase in overall retail sales in 2021 and 3.3% in 2022Q1. Consequently, online retail sales of physical goods accounted for 24.5% of overall retail sales in 2021 and 23.2% in 2022Q1. The resurgence of coronavirus in some places pose uncertainties to the economic recovery of The PRC. Following the recent outbreak of the Omicron variant, The PRC has implemented strict lockdowns in various cities. The effects of the pandemic were mostly felt in Northeast provinces, which exhibited a relatively slower growth in recent years. Omicron-driven",
    "28": "issues are likely to prolong the slowed growth and economic recovery of The PRC. However, given the high vaccination rates, The PRC is expected to overcome the coronavirus-led problems in the latter half of 2022 and the growth of the economy of The PRC remains optimistic in the medium term. According to the International Monetary Fund, the forecast of GDP in The PRC has been revised down to see a growth of 4.8% in 2022. Despite uncertainties and challenges in the short term, the economy of The PRC remains resilient, supported by continued urbanisation and a rising middle class. The sustainable economic development plans laid out by the government will continue to stimulate domestic consumption and expansion of the tertiary industry. LOGISTICS MARKET OVERVIEW Demand Drivers Amid the US-China trade dispute and COVID-19 pandemic, demand for warehouse spaces remained robust due to the growth in disposable income and consumption expenditure as well as the rapid expansion of ecommerce and 3rd party logistics (“3PLs”). Growing Disposable Income and Consumption Expenditure The urban consumption expenditure per capita of The PRC grew at a 5-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 5.6% in 2021, which is in line with the upward trend of urban disposable income per capita that grew at a 5-year CAGR of 7.1% in the same period. However, in comparison with the developed economies, the consumption expenditure per capita of The PRC, which is only about one-tenth of that of the US or one-seventh of that of Australia, still has significant room for improvement. In view of the pace of economic growth, urbanisation and rising disposable income, the consumption expenditure per capita of The PRC has a high growth potential and will be one of the key drivers of logistics demand in the country. It is anticipated to grow at",

Despite the size of the ecommerce market, ecommerce sales per capita in The PRC still has a high growth potential, due to a comparatively lower Internet penetration rate of 72% as of 2021 (Figure 1). During the COVID-19 outbreak, cities were placed under lockdown and the operation of most physical retail stores were suspended. As a result, consumers had no choice but to shift their consumptions from offline to online. From daily necessities to high-end commodity goods, almost everything could be purchased online, which accelerated the growing trend of online shopping. While physical stores gradually resumed normal operations following the containment of the COVID-19 virus, it is expected that a relatively strong growth in ecommerce would still continue amid increasing emphasis on social distancing. As online shopping becomes the trend, it also implies a robust demand for warehouses from the ecommerce sector.",

Revenue growth of 3PL service providers is evident from an increasing proportion of budget attributable to 3PL services by ecommerce retailers, which has risen from 66.0% in 2015 to 73.5% in 2021. Moreover, according to the State Post Bureau of The PRC, the annual volume of express delivery has risen to over 108.3 billion pieces in 2021, up by 29.9% YOY. 3PL firms definitely benefitted from a surge in demand for online shopping and medical goods and witnessed a boost in revenues during this period. For instance, SF Express, one of the major 3PL providers in The PRC recorded revenue growth of about 35.8% YOY in 2021 amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, leasing demand for Grade A warehouses is expected to benefit from such growth, as 3PL firms have been a dominant source of space take-up. Supply Situation The Grade A warehouse market has expanded rapidly since 2000 with a double-digit growth in supply annually. In 2021, the total stock of Grade A warehouses in The PRC stood at approximately 82.8 million square metres (“sqm”), translating to a 5-year CAGR of 21.7%. Among the four key logistics hubs, majority of the Grade A warehouses are in East China, accounting for approximately 40.0% of the total stock in The PRC, followed by Midwest China with 26.2%, North China with 21.5% and South China with 12.3%. It is expected that an additional 14.1 million sqm of Grade A warehouses will be entering the market in 2022, bringing total Grade A warehouse space to approximately 96.9 million sqm. Looking ahead, an average new supply of approximately 19.5 million sqm per year",

Leasing Performance The logistics sector was resilient amid the COVID-19 pandemic and demand for Grade A warehouses in The PRC was further boosted by the abovementioned drivers, supporting a strong net absorption. In 2021, net absorption of Grade A warehouses in The PRC was recorded at approximately 12.0 million sqm, which further pushed up the occupancy rate to 90.0% in 2021. That said, while the overall occupancy rate increased in 2021, the occupancy rate in various individual cities decreased, including cities in North China. Similarly, the rent of various cities decreased in 2021, including cities in North China such as Dalian and Changchun, while overall rent in The PRC and first-tier cities increased. This rental growth was mainly noticeable in the first half of 2021 and began to slow in 2021 Q3. Overall, the average rent rose by 2.7% YOY in 2021.

While uncertainties remain in the short term, the outlook for the development of the logistics market in the medium term is optimistic on the back of government planning, supportive policies and infrastructure projects. As The PRC continues to recover in 2022, net absorption is expected to be maintained while occupancy rate and average rent of Grade A warehouses in The PRC are forecasted to gradually increase towards the end of 2022 (Figure 3 and 4). KEY LOGISTICS HUBS Logistics Property Market Among the 27 selected cities in The PRC where Mapletree Logistics Trust has a presence in, Shanghai remained the largest Grade A warehouse market with about 7.4 million sqm of existing stock in 2021, followed by Tianjin and Chengdu with about 5.3 million sqm and 5.0 million sqm of Grade A warehouse respectively. A total of approximately 9.7 million sqm of new Grade A warehouses is forecasted to be completed in 2022 across the 27 selected cities.

    "35": "Net absorption is expected to remain in line with the new supply, supporting the occupancy rate at a similar level in 2022. A steady rental growth is anticipated in most cities in view of keen logistics demand. Upcoming Infrastructure and Policies In the fifth annual session of the 13th National People’s Congress held in March 2022, President Xi Jinping reported that The PRC intends to set a target of around 5.5% of economic growth by establishing and maintaining free trade zones and bonded areas in central and western regions, and will continue to push for the Belt and Road Initiative and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Also, under the National Logistics Hub Distribution and Construction Plan advocated by the government, infrastructure improvement projects will continue to be rolled out to facilitate the development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Area, Yangtze River Delta Area and the Greater Bay Area into regional logistics hubs. Amid increasing cross-city and cross-border economic activities, logistics demand in the region is expected to be strong. OUTLOOK The PRC announced a “dual circulation” strategy to reduce dependence on overseas markets and technology in 2020. With an aim to foster self-sufficiency and resilience, the strategy is expected to become a key priority in the government’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025). The PRC will rely mainly on “internal circulation” for its development, which is the domestic cycle of production, distribution and consumption supported by innovation and upgrades in the economy. The authorities endeavour to boost tech innovation, push Chinese firms up the global value chain, boost household incomes, and in turn, further stimulate domestic consumption. Throughout 2021, The PRC implemented property tightening measures which aimed at softening prices and increasing the affordability of properties. In late 2021, The PRC began to ease the cap on loans for the real estate sector. In February",
    "36": "2022, the People’s Bank of China announced that loans related to affordable housing will no longer be subjected to regulatory curbs, which encourages financial institutions to increase support for the development of affordable rental housing. Authorities implemented real estate curbs in 2021 but began to ease such policies towards the end of the year. The fluctuations in policies might create confusion and cause uncertainties in the short term. Growth of the primary drivers of warehouse space in The PRC, ecommerce and 3PLs, accelerated in 2021 because of the stay-at- home economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic. With the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, coupled with The PRC’s strict Zero- COVID policy, the shifts in consumer patterns are expected to remain in the near future, which supports the continued demand for online shopping and the need for warehouses and storage spaces. On the supply side, the Zero-COVID policy has led to sudden factory shutdowns and even lockdowns in certain cities. Such issues have disrupted supply chains in The PRC and have led to growing logistics concerns. Despite this uncertainty and potential disruption to factory operations and logistics, freight forwarder and 3PL companies have explored means of expanding their capacities and global presence. Notable deals in 2021 include the establishment of China Logistics Group through the merger of five state-owned logistics companies, namely China Railway Materials, China National Materials Storage and Transportation Group, Huamao International Freight Limited Company Shenzhen Branch, China Logistics, and China National Packaging Corporation, as well as SF Holding’s purchase of 51.8% stake in Kerry Logistics. Overall, further development and expansion of ecommerce and 3PLs are expected in 2022. Travel restrictions in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic had also led to severe disruptions to the supply chains since the beginning of 2020. Many companies worldwide have revisited their inventory",
    "37": "management strategies. In order to minimise disruption risk from geographical uncertainties, companies are considering a switch from the traditional just-in-time strategy, which strives to keep as little inventory as possible, to the just-in-case strategy, which relies on having surplus inventory. For instance, Parkson Retail Group Limited, which manages a network of department stores and retail operations across 28 cities in The PRC, recorded an inventory growth of about 11% and about 15% YOY in 2020 and in 2021 respectively during the COVID-19 pandemic. The inventory of retailers is anticipated to grow by 10%-15% serving as a buffer in case of disruptions to the supply chain. The warehouse market is expected to benefit from the increasing demand for storage space driven by this trend. With regard to the aforesaid, the Grade A warehouse market in The PRC is considered relatively resilient amid the COVID-19 global pandemic. While risks and uncertainties remain in the short term, the Grade A warehouse market in The PRC is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. 84 | Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2021/2022 ADVANCING OUR REACH CAPTURING OPPORTUNITIES Performance INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH Hong Kong HONG KONG ECONOMY Key Economic Indicators According to the Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong’s economic recovery slowed down in the first quarter of 2022, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracting by 4.0% year-on-year (“y-o-y”) in real terms, due to the outbreak of the fifth wave of COVID-19 infections, which dampened economic sentiments. The growth of imports and exports of goods also slowed to 2.9% and 3.4% y-o-y respectively in the first three months of 2022. It should be noted that as one of the four pillars of the economy, trading and logistics accounted for 20.6% of GDP in terms of basic prices in 2020 (Figure 1). Economic Forecasts",

COVID-19 Impact 2021 impact The gradual containment of COVID-19 in 2021 resulting from increased vaccination rates and effective social distancing measures allowed Hong Kong to make a steady recovery. Strong local spending power supported a swift rebound in retail sales of 8.1% over the year. The hospitality sector, which was the hardest hit during the height of the pandemic in 2020, also registered a 31.7% rebound in revenue per available room (“RevPAR”), with the average occupancy rate increasing to 62%, arising from local hotel demand as well as the need for quarantine rooms. Talks of progressive and partial border reopening with Mainland China in 2022 are currently also underway. The various social distancing measures implemented, as well as emerging work- from-home (WFH) trends, have accelerated e-commerce demand locally, with e-commerce retail sales reaching US$22.3 billion in 2021. According to Statista, e-commerce revenue is expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 14.2% from 2022 to 2025. Against this backdrop, the local logistics sector outpaced the growth of most industries. With air cargo movements being the least affected by border restrictions, local air cargo throughputs rebounded significantly by 12.5% in 2021 y-o-y, while container throughput also stabilised over the same period. Q1/2022 Impact The outbreak of Omicron at the start of the year softened businesses and retail sentiment as the number of daily cases surged to over 60,000 in February, but gradually receded to below 10,000 per day towards the end of March. Local retail sales suffered, but retail- related logistics",

External uncertainties, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the re-emergence of COVID-19 cases in China, disrupted both global and regional supply chains. Nevertheless, the immediate impact of the former on the local logistics sector has been minimal so far. The Mainland outbreak, however, had a much more profound impact on daily necessities, and the affected areas were mostly land transport to supermarkets and wet markets. Merchandise Trade Forecasts Exports and imports are both expected to register moderate growth ranging from 2.8% to 6.1% per annum from 2022 to 2026. The figures are slightly higher than the average growth of 2.9% in real GDP forecast for Hong Kong’s four major trading partners; China, the United States, Japan and the European Union over the same period, but lean more towards the 5.1% average GDP growth of China, reflecting its increasing importance to the local trading and logistics sectors (Figure 2). WAREHOUSE MARKET OVERVIEW Warehouse Stock1 by Category and Distribution Hong Kong’s warehouse stock has grown at a relatively low CAGR of 0.5% per annum over the past 20 years.

These factors have combined to cause vacancies in modern warehouse to decline to 1.5% in Q1/2022. WAREHOUSE RENTAL TRENDS The trading and retail sales segments were impacted by social unrest and the trade war along with the pandemic. This resulted in a weak performance, leading to declining logistics demand and dampening modern warehouse rental growth in both 2019 and 2020. With firmer business prospects in 2021, many logistics operators opted to renew leases in Q3/2021, averaging six to nine months ahead of expiry, to avoid any business disruption. Modern warehouses in both Kwai Tsing and Tsuen Wan, as well as general warehouses in Tuen Mun, recorded a number of renewal cases of long-term tenants. Other logistics operators saw their businesses grow in the buoyant market conditions in 2021 and decided to expand and relocate. Both 3PLs (such as Kerry Logistics and Hi-speed Logistics) and end users (such as Coca-cola and Park’N Shop) have made moves over the past few months to expand and consolidate into new warehouse locations to suit their business expansion needs. In Q1/2022, external uncertainties, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the re-emergence of COVID cases in China, disrupted both global and regional supply chains. Nevertheless, the immediate impact of the former on the local logistics sector has been minimal so far.

Government-related logistics demand was surprisingly active over the quarter with a few large warehouse floor plates reportedly leased to various government departments in Chai Wan and Tuen Mun. The escalating COVID-19 situation locally has induced logistics demand for medical equipment, virus-prevention materials as well as testing / protective items sourced from different countries to be distributed locally in a timely manner. At the end of Q1/2022, average modern warehouse rents stood at HK$14.1 per sq ft gross, an 8.6% y-o-y increment and a 4.8% downward adjustment from Q2/2019. General warehouses, which are mainly owned by local individual landlords / industrialists, were slower in terms of marking their asking rents to market. At the end of Q1/2022, average overall warehouse rents stood at HK$11.6 per sq ft gross, a 6.5% y-o-y rebound and a 5.1% decline from Q2/2019 (Figure 6).

This supply comprises one project in Tuen Mun, one mega project on the Airport Island, and one logistics site tendered by the Government in Kwai Chung (Table 2). While local logistics demand remains intact in the short-term, the continuation of the Russia- Ukraine war, as well as the re-emergence of COVID-19 infections in Mainland China will continue to cause global and regional supply chain disruption, which may have an adverse effect on the local logistics scene from Q2 onwards.

Areas benefiting from newly completed infrastructure, such as Liantang / Heung Yuen Wai Border Control Point in the North-eastern New Territories, as well as Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link linking up Tuen Mun South and Hong Kong International Airport, should also see improving demand prospects. Another recent trend boosting the demand for short-term warehouses is the increasing demand for cold storage. With COVID-19 resulting in social distancing measures, there has been an increasing need for chilled meat and frozen food from households. In 2021, there was greater relocation and expansion of cold store operators, such as 100 Storage Cold-Chain Logistics Services relocating and leasing two units on 6/F (around 120,000 sq ft) of Hutchison Logistics Centre in Kwai Chung. We also saw others renewing their leases to avoid business disruption, such as Beidahuang Logistics Limited in their cold store in Seapower Industrial Centre in Kwun Tong. With a typical cold store demanding very high building specifications (4-5m clear ceiling height and 17.5 kPa floor loading), warehouses possessing such specifications should be in demand over the next two to three years.

Modern warehouses, which continued to record a 20% premium over overall rents in Q4/2021, have a brighter outlook in light of growth from cross-border e-commerce and cold chain logistics, as well as the structural shift towards air freight and high value- added goods. As operational efficiencies and modern facilities become increasingly crucial in the logistics sector, rents for modern warehouses are expected to post a relatively stronger performance compared to the overall market over the next four years. Variations in supply, though, will limit rental growth for modern warehouses in 2023 to 0% but this will only be temporary (Table 3).

Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2021/2022 | 89 ADVANCING OUR REACH CAPTURING OPPORTUNITIES Performance India by JLL Property Consultants INDIA MARKET OVERVIEW Macro-Economic Overview The wide-spread outbreak of COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions to India and the global economy. On the other hand, the pandemic has spurred the development of many industries due to accelerated shifts in technology, consumer behavior, supply- chains, geo-politics, climate change and a host of other factors. India has shown a “V” shape recovery in various economic estimates. Advance estimates indicate that India has recovered past the pre-pandemic levels witnessing real GDP expansion of 8.9 per cent in 2021-22 after contracting 8 per cent in 2020-21. India’s agriculture and allied sector was the least impacted by the pandemic and the sector is expected to grow by 3.9% in 2021-22 as compared to 3.6% in the previous year. Gross value added for the industry will rise by 11.8% in 2021-22 as compared to -7% in 2020-21. The Services sector, the most affected sector by the pandemic, is estimated to grow by 8.2% in the current year following last year’s -8.4% contraction. Investment, as measured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is expected to see strong growth of 15% in 2021-22 and achieve full recovery of pre-pandemic levels. Government policies through capex and infrastructure spending has increased capital formation in the economy, raising the ratio of investment to GDP to about 29.6% in 2021-22. India’s net exports were negative in the first half of 2021-22 compared to the surplus in the corresponding period of 2020-21. The current account recorded a moderate deficit of 0.2% of GDP in the first half of the year. From a demand perspective, India’s total exports and imports surpassed pre-pandemic levels. One",
    "50": "of the key factors driving demand is pent up demand which was not met during major waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Expansionary monetary policies by developed economies are also pushing external demand for India’s exports. Exports are expected to grow by 16.5% in 2021-22. Imports have also recovered strongly with domestic demand and rising prices of imported crude and metals. Imports are expected to grow by 29.4% in 2021-22. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation moderated to 5.2% in 2021-22 (April- December) from 6.6% in the corresponding period of 2020-21. Wholesale Price Inflation (WPI), however, has been hitting double- digits at 13%. The inflation in the ‘fuel and power’ group of WPI was above 20% reflecting higher international petroleum prices. Foreign Investment, consisting of foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI), is the largest component of the capital account of India’s economy. Falling short of pre-pandemic levels, the net foreign investment inflows (FIIs) – primarily driven by FDI – moderated to US$ 25.4 billion in H1FY 22 compared to corresponding period of FY 21 as US$ 31.5 billion. Logistics Market Snapshot The resilience of the industrial and warehousing market has been tested as the COVID-19 pandemic affected India’s economic growth trajectory. After demonstrating resilience in 2020, the warehousing market has shown recovery in 2021 with demand reaching pre-COVID levels. Indian warehousing is currently going through a transformation phase in terms of quality storage spaces (primarily Grade A space), demand for larger boxes and absorption and positioning of warehouse location. Stock and Supply Scenario In Q1 2022, India witnessed a 19% year-on- year (“y-o-y”) growth in the total stock of Grade A and B warehousing space in the top eight cities. The overall warehousing space stands at 297 mn sq.ft. at the end of Q1 2022 as compared to 249",
    "51": "mn sq.ft. in the previous year. Interestingly, Grade A stock in India stood at 139 mn sq.ft., translating to a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 28.9%. There is steady increase in investments from the institutional developers for developing quality Grade A spaces. These spaces are expected to cater to the increasing demand from consumer-driven sectors such as E-Commerce, 3PL, FMCG, Retail, etc. as well as some manufacturing sectors such as Auto & Ancillaries, Engineering, Electronics & White Goods, etc. Among the eight major cities, more than half of the warehousing stock is contributed by the three largest cities of the country including Delhi NCR, Mumbai and Bengaluru. The country’s warehousing market witnessed new supply of 9 mn sq.ft. in Q1 2022 and is expected to witness an additional 35.6 mn sq.ft. of supply by the end of 2022. This supply is majorly provided by institutional developers/ investors such as Indospace, ESR, Blackstone, Ascendas, LOGOS as well as regional developers such as NDR, Global Group, Mussadilal, etc. The stock is further projected to reach 361 mn sq.ft. by 2023 and the new supply is expected to be rapidly absorbed on the back of existing strong demand (Figure 1). Warehouse Demand Dynamics The warehousing sector has shown robust recovery in 2021 and Q1 2022, with industrial demand reaching pre-COVID times with the net demand recorded at 8.0 mn sq.ft. in Q1 2022. In addition, more than 60% of this net demand was observed in Grade A space, showing a shift in occupiers’ preference towards quality spaces due to adherence to additional hygiene and safety norms during COVID-19. The high demand of quality spaces has reduced the Grade A vacancy from 12.2% in Q1 2021 to 8.4% in Q1 2022. Figure 1: Stock Projection for Select Eight Cities 2016 2017 2018 2019",

The improving consumer market, development of 3PL and e-commerce gaining traction are the fundamental drivers of logistics demand in India. The future outlook for the growth of the warehousing demand is positive in India with net absorption projected to cross the 40 mn sq.ft. mark by 2025. A strong net absorption as well as gradual reduction in overall vacancy are expected in the upcoming years (Figure 2). Key Warehousing Markets Among the eight major cities in India with strong warehouse market presence, Delhi NCR remains the largest warehouse market with highest share of Grade A warehousing space of the country. The region has more than 74 mn sq.ft. of stock in Q1 2022 with 27.6 mn sq.ft. belonging to the Grade A category. This is followed by Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru cities with 23 mn sq.ft., 20 mn sq.ft. and 19 mn sq.ft. of Grade A stock respectively. Although the cities have witnessed substantial new supply additions this year, the vacancy rate in the majority of the cities generally hovers at a healthy level of around 15% in 2021, except Ahmedabad where the warehouse market is still at a nascent stage of development (Figure 3). Furthermore, rents in these cities have shown positive growth in Q1 2022 with average rent",

Cities such as Pune have seen average Grade A rents reaching INR 26.9 per sq.ft. per month while Ahmedabad achieved INR 17.3 per sq.ft. per month. A steady growth in rent is anticipated in most cities considering robust logistics demand (Figure 4). Bengaluru’s warehousing market has recovered at a strong pace from the pandemic in 2021 and in Q1 2022 with the net demand reaching 2019 levels. This is due to the strong occupier interest on the back of consumption led demand from this region. Its key warehouse clusters including Tumkuru Road, Hoskote and Hosur Road have been the focus areas by the 3PL and e-commerce sectors. Bengaluru witnessed supply and absorption of 2.32 mn sq.ft. and 2.45 mn sq.ft. respectively in Q1 2022. Grade A contribution in supply and demand has remained more than 75% in this quarter showing occupiers’ preference towards quality spaces. Pune is another city whose warehousing market showed strong resilience amid COVID-19 and recovered in the year 2021 and in Q1 2022. The two key drivers for the warehousing demand in the city include manufacturing and consumption. The city provides a thriving manufacturing ecosystem in regions such as Chakan, Talegaon and Nagar Road. The warehousing rents in the city are highest among all due to the high land prices. Despite high rentals in warehousing sub-markets of Chakan-Talegaon and Nagar Road, the demand from e-commerce players are increasing due to the presence of good quality Grade A spaces and strong connectivity. In Q1 2022, Pune witnessed supply and absorption of 1.1 mn sq.ft. and 1.3 mn sq.ft. respectively. Interestingly, more than 60% of the demand and supply is observed in Grade A space as well as more than 80% of the Figure 2: India Net",

Growing E-Commerce Industry in India The e-commerce sector, along with the 3PL sector, has emerged as the main driver of the Indian warehousing market. The share of the e-commerce sector in transactions has increased from 15% in 2017 to 26% in 2021. Many e-commerce companies are expected to grow as people adopt a behavioral shift from buying offline to online. The pandemic has accelerated e-commerce adoption rates, leading to an increase in the demand for online delivery of essential and non-essential items. The growth in e-commerce has turned warehouse and distribution centers into mega fulfillment centers, translating to demand for larger space requirement as haves been witnessed in India recently. There were instances of global e-commerce transactions",
    "55": "with average box sizes of more than 2 lakhs sq.ft. going up to 1 million sq.ft. in cities such as NCR, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Kolkata etc. Although, COVID-19 has resulted in reduced dependency on single large warehouses, the demand for smaller warehouses is concentrated in the in-city (urban logistics) for last-mile delivery. Spurting Demand for In-City/ Urban Logistics Urban logistics in India enjoyed a strong pick-up in demand post-pandemic as consumers move to online channels for purchases. As a result, the Indian market has seen a surge in key players including global e-commerce companies such as Blinkit, Chaayos, Suppr Daily, etc. to increase penetration into warehouses in the city in order to increase the efficiency of same-day delivery services. India is expected to witness an additional ~7 mn sq.ft. of in-city warehouse space demand by 2022 spread across tier 1 and tier 2 cities. With the advent of changing consumer behavior and technology adoption, urban logistics spaces can be a game-changer in catering to the rising demand in cities for faster order fulfilment rates. Demand for urban logistics space is likely to be a growing and sustainable trend. Demand from 3PL Logistics Players With the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017, corporate strategies for warehousing and distribution strategies have changed. Decisions on warehouse locations and specifications are now based on supply chain efficiency considerations rather than tax-saving benefits. Consequently, there has been a shift towards the integration of small warehouses into large fulfillment centers. Logistics companies have seized this opportunity and switched from a model of managing single company warehouses to a multi-client and multi-product model. The small e-commerce players take advantage of these multi-client and multi-product facilities as they need flexibility in terms of seasonal space requirements. The companies can also benefit with cutting",

As 3PL brings in the necessary economies of scale for multi-tenant sites, the potential for growth is significant. 3PL more than 30% of the demand in 2021 and more than 43% of the demand in Q1 2022, the highest among all the other sectors. Demand from 3PL has increased as different sectors such as e-commerce, engineering, electronics and white goods are routing through 3PL. Demand for space from 3PL/Logistics may increase in 2022 as many large and medium manufacturing companies offload part of their inventory management to optimise cost. Upcoming Infrastructure and Policies The Indian government launched Production- Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for 13 key sectors (Mobile manufacturing, API & drug intermediaries, medical devices, ACC Battery, Electronic/ Technology Products, Automobile & Auto Components, Pharmaceutical drugs, Telecom & Networking Products, Textile Products, Food Products, Solar PV Modules, White Goods: AC & LEDs, Speciality Steel) for enhancing India’s manufacturing capabilities and enhancing exports. Several global firms such as Samsung, Foxconn, Hon Hai, Wistron and Pegatron have benefitted from these schemes. Industrial demand is expected to get a boost as global companies set up manufacturing operations in India. Industrial light manufacturing demand comprised 10% of the total warehouse demand in 2021 which is anticipated to increase in the upcoming years. This demand is primarily driven by established sectors such as Auto & Ancillaries and Engineering as well as emerging sectors such as Electronics & White Goods, FMCG, Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals.

Furthermore, the 100 cargo terminals to be developed over the next three years is envisaged to provide much impetus to the warehousing and logistics sector. The National Logistics Policy (NLP) is proposed to streamline and strengthen India’s logistics sector, for seamless movement of goods and to increase the ease of doing business for players in the logistics sector. It will create a single window e-logistics market focusing on improving India’s trade competitiveness, employment creation and aiding the country to become a logistics hub. In addition, new warehousing policy is planned by NHAI and Central Government to outlay the roadmap for developing exclusive warehousing zones under PPP. The purpose of the new policy is to ease transportation and logistics costs as well as improve logistics infrastructure throughout the country. These reforms are expected to elevate the overall high quality warehousing demand in India.

While the growth rate exceeded 10% in the initial half year of 2021, the rate has been slowing down slightly in the second half of the year. This is a result of the normalisation of economic activities due to the easing of COVID-19 measures and shifting consumer behaviours. However, with continued slump in consumer spending from self-isolation due to the new Omicron variant spread in 2022 and price hikes of resources due to the Russian-Ukraine war, real GDP is expected to be lower in 2022 as compared to 2021. Logistics Real Estate Market Market Overview In Japan, developers of large-scale rental logistics facilities supplied a cumulative total of approximately 37,700,000 m2 of gross floor area as at the end of December 2021. With COVID-19 accelerating the adoption of e-commerce, both demand and supply for warehouses reached record highs. Annual supply nationwide was approximately 5,000,000 m2, while demand was approximately over 4,300,000 m2. As the",
    "59": "annual supply of warehouse outpaced demand, vacancy rate increased to 2.8% in 2021, up from 1.4% at the end of 2020, and hit 3.8% as at the end of March 2022. This trend is expected to continue in the coming period (Figure 1). On the other hand, the pre-commitment rate for the following year’s supply as at the end of 2021 was 57%, in contrast to 42% this year, raising concerns about a shortage of demand for the supply of 6,000,000 m2 in 2022. In all four main metropolitan areas, vacancy rates are increasing, except in the Nagoya area, where vacancy rates were somewhat high, shortage of vacant space in the large-scale logistics facilities in 2021, and actual rental rates were on uptrend. Reasons behind high demand Demand is driven by advance leasing from e-commerce-related companies and an expansion of leases due to the consolidation of sites and the replacement of obsolete buildings by manufacturer shippers, in addition to continued leasing demand from 3PL providers. E-commerce is the most significant demand driver, with e-commerce-related demand expected to account for about a little less than 30% of total demand in 2020 through 2022, up from around 10% till 2019. However, while the e-commerce market in Japan enjoyed marked growth in 2021 partly due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, the speed of growth is returning to a more moderate pace in 2022. Reasons behind increase in supply Nationwide, an annual average of approximately 4,000,000 m2 of supply came onto the market between 2018 and 2020. Annual supply was more than 5,000,000 m2 in 2021 and is estimated to be over 6,000,000 m2 in 2022, and 7,000,000 m2 in 2023 (according to the public announcement).

    "61": "so the vacancy rate is high and rents have remained steady. Development costs have been increasing owing to the recent sharp price rises of development sites and the increase in construction costs, leading to a rise in asking rents (Figure 3). Trend in Cap Rates The expected cap rates for logistics real estate has declined nearly every year from 2011, to levels that are significantly far below the level seen prior to the Global Financial Crisis. As of October 2021, the expected cap rate multi-tenant facilities in the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas was 4.2% and 4.6% on respectively. Cap rates remained steady for some time, but started to fall due to the rise in demand for logistics real estate caused by the COVID-19 crisis (Figure 4). In many cases, cap rate has fallen to the 3% range on an NOI basis on actual sales. In addition, it is not only the developed properties but also existing income- generating properties which continue to be increasingly highly appraised and are transacted at low cap rates. Demand for Large-scale Logistics Facilities The need for large-scale rental logistics facilities remains strong. Large-scale, modern- spec facilities are highly sought after as they support efficient operations and also provide generous amenities. This suggests ample scope for upward movement in the market development rate. Main Factors behind Increased Demand and Supply Demand Factors Sustained demand of last mile delivery logistics The surge in demand for warehouse space among e-commerce-related companies is not only driven by the need for storage and distribution processing facilities but also for home delivery bases. For instance, Amazon is proactively establishing delivery stations (DS) all around Japan. While many of these DS are utilising warehouses in city centers, they are also increasingly moving into developed properties to make use of large sorting",

As such, higher rents can be seen for facilities that meet last mile delivery demand. Growing demand for cold storage facilities Demand for frozen food has been increasing locally, causing more developers to enter the cold storage facility market. Supply mostly consisted of the framework for a cold storage warehouse in the past, but increasingly, properties are being leased with refrigeration equipment. Supply Factors Continued steep rises in site prices due to a shortage of development sites Bidding prices continue to rise sharply. There are cases of bids in city areas exceeding JPY 3,000,000 per tsubo. Previously, almost all developers submitting bids for land participated actively in the market, but with the recent sharp rise in prices, a divide has opened up between developers that participate actively and those that do not. On the other hand, some tenants are looking for inexpensive rents, so they are continuing to broaden their search area (particularly in the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas).

It is increasingly common to see tangible differentiation such as the adoption of seismically isolated and damping structures, special design of exterior walls, installation of day-care facilities and stores, provision of a wide range of amenities for employees (such as clean restrooms), as well as large- scale overall development (developing multiple facilities in the same area) for maximizing installation of such features. Effort is now also being put into intangible differentiation through services that provide solutions to issues faced by tenants, such as human resource referrals, truck standby systems, and consulting on the installation of material handling equipment within a facility. Numerous small- and medium-sized facility developments have also begun focusing on basic facility specifications. Rise in regional development by developers Much of the development has been in the four main metropolitan areas mentioned above, with minimal development in areas around the Sapporo, Sendai, Hiroshima and Okayama districts. However, there has been a rise in development activity in regional cities and districts such as Morioka, Utsunomiya and Okinawa. Manufacturers and major wholesalers located in regional areas are generating demand to move into new areas, spurring the development of appropriate facilities. OUTLOOK Outlook",
    "64": "for Supply Nationwide supply in 2022 is expected to be the largest ever. Supply is also projected to be the largest ever even in the Greater Tokyo and Nagoya areas. In 2021, bids continued to be sought for sites eligible for development all around the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas, and developers have made the most of their individual networks to aggressively acquire sites. Given this situation, supply is likely to continue to be high at approximately 6,000,000 m2 for some time. Outlook for Demand Nationwide demand has increased from 4,200,000 in 2018 to 4,400,000 m2 in 2021, which was below the supply of 5,000,000 m2 in 2021. With supply expected to experience further growth in 2022, and leasing by major e-commerce site operators levelling off, demand may not keep pace with supply. E-commerce-related demand Japan’s e-commerce penetration rate is 8.08% (2020). Viewed by product type, food and beverage products, wining and dining products and alcohol have a low penetration rate in the 3% range, while household furniture, books, sundry household goods, office supplies, etc. have a high penetration rate of 20 to 40%. Development of dedicated logistics centers for online supermarkets that specialise in e-commerce sales of food and beverage products is also on the rise in Japan. Given Japan’s relatively low e-commerce penetration, there is ample room for further expansion of the e-commerce market, which will drive demand for last mile delivery and logistics facilities. Demand by 3PL providers 3PL business operations are currently on the decline, as COVID-19 reduced efforts by cargo owners to improve logistics efficiency. In addition, with higher rents, shippers are directly leasing properties in place of 3PL providers. As such, leases of large-scale rental logistics facilities by 3PL providers have declined. However, in the medium and long term, leasing by 3PL providers is",

Outlook for Supply-Demand Balance Outlook for 2022 While development volume will increase sharply in 2022, demand growth is slowing slightly, as indicated by a lower pre- commitment rate compared with 2021. The supply-demand balance is therefore likely to deteriorate and rents will stabilise or may even begin to soften in some districts. 2022 and Beyond Several factors may lead to a deterioration in the supply-demand balance, such as a large volume of supply generated by the increasing number of developers entering the market, lower rent levels sought by 3PL providers and wholesalers who are the main tenants, increased development near city areas in anticipation of high rents, and development of facilities with low-efficiency specs that seek to maximise the floor area ratio. Trends in the Logistics Real Estate Market in the Main Economic Zones Greater Tokyo area The vacancy rate in the Greater Tokyo area has trended down since 2015, falling to a low of 0.9% by 2020. The supply-demand balance remains tight but the vacancy rate at the end of 2021 increased to 2.5 % and reached 4.0% at the end of March 2022. The likely reason for this is the slowdown in the progress of activities for leasing tenants in the second half of the year due to economic slowdown (Figure 5).

The pre-commitment rate as of the end of 2021 for properties to be completed in 2022 was 41%, which is lower than the rate of 53% in 2020. There were initial concerns regarding the large volume of supply in the Nagareyama and Sagamihara districts, but leading companies in e-commerce, apparel sales, etc. have taken up the new supply. In the Chiba New Town district, manufacturers, 3PL providers, etc. have moved in and absorbed all available supply. The supply-demand balance is holding steady, without any significant disruption in particular areas resulting from a large volume of supply. The considerable tightness in the supply- demand balance eased slightly in the second half of 2021, and while the supply-demand balance may not be significantly affected by the large volume of supply in 2022, the tightness may ease further. Osaka area The vacancy rate in the Osaka area rose sharply in 2017 as a result of the large volume of supply. Subsequently, the somewhat limited supply in 2018 through 2020 coupled with strong demand saw the vacancy rate fall to 1.5% by the end of 2020. Following another year of large supply in 2021, the vacancy rate rose to 2.6%, and reached 3.2% at the end of March 2022.

New multi-tenant facilities were also recently added to the Seifushinto and Shiwa districts. Demand for logistics space around Nishi-ku (adjacent to Shoko Center) is particularly high, resulting in comparatively high rents (about JPY 4,000 per tsubo) due to limited space available. However, for other locations in Hiroshima, the prolonged COVID-19 had negatively impacted demand for warehouse, reducing the number of prospective tenants and space required as compared to pre-pandemic times. Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2021/2022 | 97 ADVANCING OUR REACH CAPTURING OPPORTUNITIES Malaysia MACRO ECONOMY OVERVIEW Gross Domestic Product and Inflation Rate Prior to the onset of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in early 2020, the Malaysian economy had consistently posted moderate annual expansion with the services and manufacturing sectors being the main drivers of growth. The spike in positive coronavirus cases since September 2020 (the third wave of infections) led to the re-imposition of various phases of movement control order - MCO 2.0 in January 2021, followed by MCO 3.0 and full lockdown (FMCO) in May 2021. The economy slipped back into contraction with GDP shrinking 4.5% in 3Q2021 (2Q2021: +16.1%), weighed down by the strict containment measures. However, the progressive lifting of containment measures and normalisation of domestic activities supported by high vaccination rates saw the economy rebounding 3.6% in 4Q2021. For the full year of 2021, Malaysia’s economy expanded 3.1%, supported by improvement in market conditions with continued policy support (Figure 1). Moving into year 2022, the country’s economy is expected to expand between 5.3% and",
    "70": "6.3%, in line with the central bank’s projection. This is underpinned by several factors including continued expansion in external demand, full easing of COVID-19 containment measures, reopening of international borders, and further improvement in labour market conditions. However, the uncertainties surrounding the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict poses risks to Malaysia’s GDP growth. The continuation of large-scale infrastructure projects such as the under-construction East Coast Rail Line (ECRL), Mass Rapid Transit Sungai Buloh-Serdang-Putrajaya Line (MRT2), Light Rail Transit Bandar Utama–Klang Line (LRT3), and Pan Borneo Highway will provide additional lift to the nation’s economic growth. As for headline inflation, it increased to 3.2% in 4Q2021 (3Q2021: 2.2%), mainly due to the lapse in the three-month electricity bill discounts, which was implemented in July 2021. For 2021, the overall headline inflation averaged at 2.5% due to the cost-push factor of higher global oil prices. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) expects headline inflation to remain moderate in 2022 as the base effect from fuel inflation dissipates. Malaysia Retail Trade and Retail Sales Malaysia’s annual retail trade, which declined 5.8% to register at RM103.8 billion in 2020 (2019: RM110.2 billion), rebounded 3.2% to RM107.1 billion in 2021 following the reopening of more economic and business sectors (Figure 2). As for retail sales growth, it contracted 2.3% in 2021 due to the lackluster performance in the first nine months of the year despite posting robust growth of 26.5% in the last quarter of the year. Malaysia External Trade The country’s total value of exports posted a significant increase of 26.0% to record at RM1,239.8 billion in 2021 (2020: RM983.8 billion). Similarly, the total value of imports also inclined by circa 23.3% to record at RM987.2 billion (2020: RM800.5 billion).

The improved performance was mainly attributed to the wide adoption of digital usage during the various phases of lockdowns and as part of the new normal. However, as physical retail businesses reopen following easing of containment measures, the pace of e-commerce growth may slow down although the internet will continue to play an important role as more retailers embrace omni-channel retailing (Figure 5). by Knight Frank Malaysia Performance 98 | Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2021/2022 ADVANCING OUR REACH CAPTURING OPPORTUNITIES Performance INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH Malaysia Figure 1: GDP Growth and Inflation Rate at Constant 2015 Prices, 2016 to 2022(p) 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020(p) 2021(p) 2022(f) 8.0 6.0 4.0 2.0 0.0 -2.0 -4.0 -6.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 -1.0 -2.0 GDP Growth (%) Inflation Rate (%) GDP Growth Inflation Rate Sources: Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) / Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) Note: (p) = Preliminary data 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021(p) 1,400.0 1,200.0 1,000.0 800.0 600.0 400.0 200.0 0.0 300.0 250.0 200.0 150.0 100.0 50.0 0.0 Exports / Imports (RM billion) Trade Balance (RM billion) Figure 3: Malaysia – External Trade, 2015 to 2021(p) Total Exports Total Imports Trade Balance Sources: Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) / Knight Frank Research Note: (p) = Preliminary data 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020(R) 2021(p) 250.0 200.0 150.0 100.0 50.0 0.0 FDI (RM billion) Figure 4: Malaysia Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), 2015 to 2021(p) Sources: Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) / Knight Frank Research Note: (R) = Revised; (p) = Preliminary data Services Sector",

While demand for supply chains is far higher than before, the logistical infrastructure is often still found wanting. The industrial market in Malaysia has seen steady growth in recent years largely due to higher e-commerce penetration rate resulting in additional warehousing space requirements to meet the surge in last-mile delivery as well as the structural shift towards omnichannel retailing. It is anticipated that the momentum gained this past year will continue into 2022 and beyond as demand remains resilient despite challenging economic conditions. With the economy entering a recovery phase from the height of the pandemic, the industrial realm within Malaysia is entering a new chapter of revolution. Whilst e-commerce growth will continue to underpin the thriving industrial real estate market performance, the new growth areas will be heavily influenced by factors driven by the RCEP, automation as well as the ESG agenda. The Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint (MyDigital), unveiled in February 2021, is the foundation for the country’s transformation into a “regional digital pulse”. The transformation is expected to boost productivity, stimulate innovation, and improve livelihoods by harnessing the internet, Big Data, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and other technologies.

Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2021/2022 | 101 ADVANCING OUR REACH CAPTURING OPPORTUNITIES Performance South Korea by Colliers MARKET ANALYSIS Highest Economic Growth in Over a Decade Despite Hikes in Interest Rate South Korea’s economy achieved the highest economic growth since 2010, hitting a growth of 4% year-on-year (“y-o-y”) in 2021, and rebounding from its pandemic-induced 0.9% y-o-y negative growth in 2020. The recovery was mainly driven by improved domestic private consumption and trade, supported by the Government’s new initiative of living with the virus. In response to the pandemic and its subsequent economic impact, the Government rolled out several expansionary policies. These included a two-phased handout of a total of KRW10 trillion subsidies for small to medium businesses, a corporate tax discount, COVID-19 relief funds and introduction of the Human New Deal policies in the Korean New Deal 2.0 update, which mainly focused on lowering unemployment rates. Under the policy, South Korea’s unemployment rate was reduced from 5.0% in Q1 2021 to 2.9% in Q4 2021, reaching its lowest level since Q3 2013. On 26 August 2021, the Bank of Korea (BOK) raised interest rates by 25 basis points, from 0.50% to 0.75%, being the first major Asian country to raise interest rates since the COVID-19 outbreak. The rates were further adjusted on 25 November 2021 and 14 January 2022, increasing a total of 75 basis points within just six months to 1.25%. These increases were to calibrate inflation and taper the rapidly growing household debt. As of December 2021, consumer price index registered a 3.7% y-o-y growth, almost double the 2.0% target from the Bank of",
    "79": "Korea. Despite two interest hikes, the economy maintained a 1.1% quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in Q4 2021, indicating an ongoing resilient recovery. In its recent announcements in January and February 2022, BOK hinted that the interest rate could be further raised in 2022 through the implementation of market stabilisation measures in a timely manner, in line with the United States Fed’s accelerating monetary policy normalisation. Korea Capital Market Institute forecasts that the BOK may further increase interest rates to 1.75% in 2022, subject to inflation rate movements. Nonetheless, the International Monetary Fund and BOK confidently forecast in January 2022 that the economy would be less affected by the interest rate hikes and is expected to grow further, by 3.0% y-o-y in 2022, driven by domestic consumption and trade. Continued Growth of E-commerce and Grade A Logistics Facilities 2021 was another strong year for e-commerce in Korea, with the e-commerce market increasing 16.5% y-o-y and volume reaching KRW175 trillion, accounting for approximately 38% of total retail sales volume. The volume of mobile transactions has also shown a noticeable y-o-y increase of 22.9% to reach KRW12.5 trillion in 2021, contributing to the growth of courier services, which has consequently led to an increase in demand for Grade A logistics properties. In 2021, the Food and Beverage (11.9%) and Food Services (11.8%) sectors were responsible for this online shopping wave, boosted by the increase in single or two- person households and subsequent rising demand for meal kits, food deliveries and courier services. According to latest Statistics Korea release in Q3 2021, the number of single or two-person household accounted for about two-third of national total, and had higher consumption tendency than other household types. Domestic courier transaction volume increased 9.4% y-o-y as of November 2021, maintaining steady growth of 20.9% y-o-y from 2019 to",
    "80": "2020. Meal kit transactions grew 150% y-o-y from KRW200 billion in 2020 to KRW300 billion in 2021 and are expected to reach KRW700 billion by 2024. Fast delivery services have also been rising in demand ever since more retail companies converted into online sales platforms, adapting to the prolonged pandemic and social distancing measures. The giant offline retail player E-mart liquidated its assets when it acquired E-bay Korea in June 2021. Also, emerging giants in fresh food and early morning delivery services such as Market Kurly, Oasis, and SGG.COM are expected to go public in the second half of 2022, gaining higher liquidity to expand capacity. This intense demand for Grade A logistics facilities is expected to continue in 2022. As operators of fresh food and meal kit services often require dry and cold storage spaces, the leasing trend has shifted towards sizable hybrid centres. E-commerce players are advancing their same-day or next-day services by including overnight-delivery schedules, thus seeking leasing opportunities within large-scale logistics facilities with automation processes near major cities to handle high delivery volumes. Existing Stock and Future Pipeline in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) According to the Building Registry of Korea and Colliers’ research, about 2.9 million sq. m. in logistics warehousing was added to the SMA during 2021. Most of this new stock was in the Southeast and Northwest submarket with 1.7 million sq. m. and 0.8 million sq. m, respectively. As at the end of 2021, logistics centres in the SMA provided about 24.2 million sq. m. gross floor area, with the traditional logistics hub of Southeast submarket accounting for about 39.7% of it (Figure 1). 102 | Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2021/2022 ADVANCING OUR REACH CAPTURING OPPORTUNITIES Performance INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH South Korea Source: Colliers Table 1: New Supply in the 2022",

Despite the shortage of new logistics facility supplies in the Northeast and Southern submarket, newly introduced mega-scale logistics centres such as Hanaro TNS logistic centre and ADF Yongin Logistic Centre in the Southeast submarket contributed to the increase in overall supply volume. Most of the new stock in 2022 and 2023 will be added in the Southeast, followed by Northwest and Southwest markets. However, the scarcity of land for large-scale developments in the traditional submarket of the Southeast is pushing developers to the Southwest and Northwest. Other than 3.4 million sq. m. of developments planned in 2022 and 2023, additional large-scale development in the Southeast submarket will be limited in 2024 and",
    "82": "onwards (Figure 2). The Northwest Submarket, driven mainly by Incheon’s demand, has been attracting developers due to its capability to host mega-scale logistic centres and its accessibility. Multiple mega-scale logistic centres will be developed in the next two years, bringing about 3.3 million sq. m. fresh supply to the area. Most large-scale logistic centres are expected to be developed in Siheung and Pyeongtaek from 2024 onwards (Table 1). SMA Logistics Market Leasing Performance Despite the recent surge in supply, the average vacancy rate in logistics assets in the SMA remained tight at 3.3% as of Q4 2021, on the back of significant demand for new and modern logistics centres. Pre- leasing agreements have been occurring across multiple recent Grade A logistics centre developments, due to an increasing number of developers adopting built-to- suit strategies. Most new centres, especially those with a superior location, accessibility, and modern facilities, could secure 100% commitment during pre-leasing or contain the absorption period within a quarter upon completion. Typical rent-free periods range between one to three months for lease terms of up to five years. Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2021/2022 | 103 ADVANCING OUR REACH CAPTURING OPPORTUNITIES Performance More mega-scale logistics facilities are due for completion over the next two years in the northwest and southwest submarkets. However, with the continuous growth in e-commerce, we forecast the vacancy rate will not go past the 5% mark (Figure 3). Overall average rent in the SMA recorded a 2.7% y-o-y increase in 2021 to around KRW9,156 per sq. m. Rental growth was spurred by newly completed prime Grade A logistics centres. Looking beyond 2022, we expect rental growth to be driven by premium Grade A logistic centres at around 2-3%, and other centres to see an increase of 1-3% (Figure 4). Strong Capital Value Growth and",
    "83": "Yield Compression 2021 was another all-time record-breaking year for South Korea’s logistics market. Transactions in 2020 were worth a record- breaking KRW2.6 trillion, which more than doubled to around KRW5.3 trillion over 2021. The phenomenal growth during the pandemic has made the logistics sector the most desirable and secure income product amongst all other real estate asset classes. Competition for quality logistics centres has heated up among domestic and international investors, and the cap rates for SMA logistics centres have compressed significantly over the past three years. For instance, GS Networks Dohwa logistics centre and Samdeok TLS logistics centre transacted at a 3.8% and 3.7% cap rate respectively in 2021. As of 2021, the spread between the SMA logistics and Seoul general office cap rate has narrowed to only 40 basis points. Due to significant cap rate compression and rising confidence in the logistics sector, an increasing number of experienced investors are willing to take development risks, entering the market during the planning and development stage, or through forward purchase before completion to maximise investment return. For instance, in Q4 2021, AEW acquired two Grade A logistics properties in Yeoju and Incheon, estimated to be completed in 2022 and 2023, respectively, at KRW633 billion. Hana Alternative Investment purchased Anseong Ga-ri logistics centre, scheduled for completion in April 2022 at KRW60 billion. Major international funds, including Hines, Nuveen, Goldman Sachs, and Brookfield, have also invested in the development stage. Nonetheless, owing to the expected interest hike in 2022, we expect the average cap rate for SMA logistics facilities to rise moderately in the short term. However, modern logistics assets in favourable locations are likely to continue enjoying cap rate compression along with the fast-maturing market (Figure 5).

Anseong has had a relatively lower rental level due to its distance to Seoul, but new stock and leasing demand coming from saturated traditional logistics hubs contributed to its higher rental increase than other cities during the same period, except for Yeoju.

ECONOMIC OVERVIEW The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted Vietnam’s economy, causing a slower than expected GDP growth in 2021 of 2.58%. However, increasing vaccination rates have allowed many businesses to reopen and reduced the amount of border restrictions. Import and export turnover of goods still had a fair growth outlook with a value of 668.5 billion USD. FDI capital in 2021 also increased by 9.2% year-on-year (“y-o-y”) to USD 31.15 billion, according to Vietnam’s General Statistics Office. With the country’s stable macro-economic conditions, improving business environment, developing infrastructure, sustained foreign investment as well as growing manufacturing and export sectors, Vietnam is expected to make a gradual recovery after the pandemic. The country set the economic targets for 2022 at 6.0-6.5% GDP growth while forecasts by international organizations are also at the same level, at 6.5% as per HSBC and 5.5%",
    "87": "as per World Bank. Particularly, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has named Vietnam as one of the fastest-growing economies in ASEAN, with forecasted GDP growth at 7.2% in 2022. VIETNAM WAREHOUSE MARKET The US-China trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic compelled companies to relocate, reconfigure, and diversify their supply chains to mitigate risks. These trends have underscored Vietnam’s attractiveness to foreign investors, due to its competitive advantage in areas such as favorable demographics, enhanced economic integration, preferential incentives from supportive government policies, an improving business environment and legal framework as well as rapid infrastructure improvements. Demand for logistics & warehousing space is on the rise due to FDI and manufacturing activities increasing steadily over the years, along with the increase in domestic economic growth and consumption. Similarly, Vietnam market also witnessed growth in retail & e-commerce sectors which has increased demand for logistics and warehousing space. In particular, B2C e-commerce revenue recorded an average growth of 24% p.a. in 2016 – 2020 and is expected to maintain that growth rate in the following period (2021 – 2025), while total retail sales of consumer goods and services also increased by 9.4% p.a. on average during the same period. Particularly, the growing demand for convenience, such as on-demand delivery of fresh produce, has spurred the development of end-to-end cold-chain networks. While Vietnam’s logistics market is currently dominated by international third-party logistics service providers (“3PLs”), local players have been gradually developing their presence in the market, including notable names such as Gemadept, Nhat Tin, and Vinafco. Growing interest from international investors to enter into joint ventures as well as a surge in merger and acquisitions have supported the growth of local companies. In the South, there is a concentration of logistics facilities in Ho Chi Minh City (“HCMC”), Long An, Dong Nai, Binh",
    "88": "Duong, and Ba Ria – Vung Tau (A.K.A. Southern Economic Zone). These areas cater to ecommerce, express, pharma, retail, and manufacturing sectors demands. New infrastructure developments, such as connecting road network between Hiep Phuoc, Cat Lai, and Cai Mep ports; and Long Thanh International Airport also look to improve logistics efficiency in the region. Binh Duong is the country’s leading logistics hub due to stable demand and abundant supply. HCMC, Long An, or Dong Nai are established alternative logistics hubs with greater demands from specified sectors such as distribution, e-commerce, and pharma & chemical warehousing. Many warehouses in these alternative locations are expected to commence development in early 2022. Long Thanh International Airport is expected to be surrounded by 6,000 ha of industrial park once completed. Long An looks to take advantages of its location with a strong supply pipeline and intermodal transportation potential linking to Cai Mep International Seaport in Ba Ria – Vung Tau and Tay Ninh Border Gate. In the North, significant investments from Multinational Corporations (“MNCs”) like SEA Logistic Partners, an industrial and logistic facility development and operation platform backed by GLP, Logos and GAW NP have catalyzed demand for logistics facilities, particularly in Bac Ninh, Thai Nguyen and Hai Phong. Other locations, such as Bac Giang, Vinh Phuc and Hung Yen Provinces have also seen increased demand. Hung Yen boasts of several advantages such as proximity to Hanoi, accessibility to key manufacturing clusters and developed infrastructure, such as National Road 5B which links Hanoi to Hai Phong, as well as available land and lower costs. While the northern warehousing market is smaller than those in the south, the surge in manufacturing supported by developed infrastructure is expected to accelerate market growth.

Two significant warehouse projects commenced construction in 2021, namely the International Logistics Center (71 h.a.) in Bac Giang Province, and ICD Vinh Phuc (83 h.a.) in Vinh Phuc Province. The relatively low supply of available warehouse space presents an opportunity for logistics developments with higher yields and rental rates, thereby attracting more investments to the north. This report describes the respective warehouse markets in Bac Ninh and Binh Duong. BAC NINH WAREHOUSE MARKET OVERVIEW Economic Overview Bac Ninh’s economy expanded rapidly during 2015 – 2018 driven by investments from large manufacturing companies. However, it experienced a considerable decline in gross regional domestic product (“GRDP”) growth in 2019 to only 1.1% due to a decrease in phone and accessories production, particularly from Samsung Electronics and Samsung Display. In 2021, despite the heavy impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the province posted significant growth of 6.9%, with the industrial sector showing positive signs as the Index of Industrial Production (“IIP”) expanded 9.7% (Figure 1). Despite sluggish growth in 2019-2020, Bac Ninh remains one of the largest industrial hubs of Vietnam and among the leading investment destinations in the North. Due to sustained inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), development of domestic enterprises, improvement of business environment as well as rising labor productivity, the outlook for the provincial economy is expected to remain positive. FDI is considered the main driver of economic development in Bac Ninh. A favorable geographical position, abundant labor force, good infrastructure for production and support from government policies have made the province an attractive investment destination for foreign investors. 106 | Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2021/2022 ADVANCING OUR REACH CAPTURING OPPORTUNITIES Performance INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH Source: Bac Ninh Statistics Office Figure 1: Bac Ninh GRDP, GRDP Growth and IIP Growth by Year 2015",

The province continued to be among the top 5 destinations in attracting foreign investments. As of 2021, the province ranked 4th nationwide with 4,021 effective projects with a total investment capital of US$37.2 billion, second only to HCMC. (Figure 6 and 7). Furthermore, the province is transforming its economy by focusing more on service industries, high tech production, and sustainable urbanization to capitalise on the Industrial Revolution 4.0 wave. This will boost global economic cooperation and attract more investments into the province. In 2021, Binh Duong ranked 6th nationwide on the Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI) with a score of 69.61/100 and ranked 1st in the Southeast Region.

A project named Frasers My Phuoc 3 in Ben Cat Town became active in Q4 2021, adding over 42.000 sq.m to the market. With its proximity to HCMC, there is a strong demand for warehouse space to support ecommerce and foreign/ local retailers. Despite disruptions caused by the pandemic from 2020-2021,",
    "95": "export growth is expected to continue to be positive in 2022, which provides further impetus for warehousing to serve inbound/outbound goods and consolidation for manufacturing. Most manufacturing sites are now fully occupied and earmarked for expansion while warehousing requirements are outsourced. Despite the large supply added in the last three years, the overall occupancy rate of warehouses in Binh Duong has remained at a healthy level of 94%, indicating sustained market demand in this region. However, overall occupancy fell to 88% in Q4 2021, mainly due to low occupancy of the newly- launched project in Ben Cat Town. The figure is expected to increase again in the following period (2022 – 2025), with the only exception in 2023 when occupancy decreased to below 90% as the market welcomes an influx of new supply.

Rents in this area are relatively lower, catering to clients who are more concerned about price rather than specifications. Meanwhile, the southern submarket in Di An and Thuan An Cities offers higher average rent of US$5.00 – US$5.50/sq.m/month as they are the most sought-after areas, being close to HCMC, as well as the current and future international airport and seaports.

Di An City, which is the closest to HCMC, will be the hub accounting for 48% of future supply, with large supply stock from TBS Logistics and BWID. Thu Dau Mot City came second with 31%, mostly from Mapletree. The remaining supply is located in Ben Cat and Tan Uyen Town, with a portion of 12% and 9%, respectively (Table 2). More consolidation of fulfillment and distribution centers will be seen around VSIP 2 and VSIP 3 in Binh Duong, which are linked to My Phuoc - Tan Van Highway. Growing private consumption as a result of the expanding middle class and the accompanying increase in imports of consumption goods will continue to boost demand for warehouse space. In addition, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the e-commerce revenue of Vietnam in 2021 is estimated to reach US$13.7 billion, increasing 16% y-o-y, making Vietnam one of the top three countries with the highest growth rate of online retail market share in the Southeast Asia region. Binh Duong is the second biggest catchment market after HCMC for Tiki, Shopee, and Lazada. Favorable conditions from the Government’s policies and participation in APEC, WTO, FTAs, etc., will boost FDI, from which Binh Duong will benefit greatly as the province has a reputation for attracting FDI. In the next two years, the market outlook remains positive with low vacancy and high rentals expected. However, rent growth is expected to moderate due to the consolidation of scattered warehousing portfolios, in addition to the significant addition of supply from new players like Logos, JD Property, NP/ Gaw, Cainiao, KCN Vietnam.
