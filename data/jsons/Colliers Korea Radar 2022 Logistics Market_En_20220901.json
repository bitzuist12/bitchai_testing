Current trends in the logistics sector include: • Despite rising interest rates, logistics investments continue to be popular, pushing up sales prices. • Rising development costs are pushing investors to prioritize existing, stabilized logistics assets, instead of pursuing maximizing return strategies during wholesale development. • To prepare for falling yields, investors need to shift their focus to risk management to mitigate rising construction costs. • With the increase in supply of cold storage followed by expansion of the fresh food market, the market has a growing concern about rising cold storage vacancy. • We expect 3PL and e-commerce leasing demand to continue increasing along with increasing e- commerce and courier volumes. • The sector is increasingly focused on technology-enabled logistics center management, and the number of logistics centers adopting ESG policies is increasing. Insights & key takeaways ✓ Decreasing transaction volume and increasing cap rate ✓ Tighter licensing and regulation of new logistics ✓ Rising construction costs due to increasing raw material costs ✓ Increasing supply of cold storage raises vacancy ✓ Continuously rising volumes of E-commerce ✓ Upgrading logistics technology and adapting ESG ✓ Increasing borrowing costs due to rising interest rates Key logistics market issues 3 Southeast • S o ’ d o o , most familiar to logistics investors • Large new supply schedule leads to a saturated market • New development permits are restricted due to increased fire inspections and civil complaints Market Overview by Region Major submarkets Major submarket Source: Colliers District",

Increased supply of new logistics centers in Northwest The Northwest area, including Incheon, is the second largest logistics supply cluster after the Southeast. We expect the supply is the Northwest submarket to increase in the next two years, becoming the next major logistics supply cluster.

But development permits are becoming difficult. Due to the proximity to Seoul, large warehouses are concentrated in the area to support last mile delivery. ESR Kendall Square REIT owns 15 of the 18 operating assets located in the Southeast.

As the volume of overseas direct purchases increases, we expect logistics demand near Incheon International Airport to increase. At the same time, large supply makes it the region with the second highest supply after the traditional logistics region, the Southeast. Incheon has ongoing development concentrated around industrial complexes, rather than residential areas, drawing fewer civil complaints compared to other areas. However, the wave of incoming cold storage supply brings us concern about rising vacancy in Incheon. Active foreign capital investment Foreign investors are actively deploying their capital in Incheon logistics assets. Recently, GIC purchased Aster Hangdong Center for KRW585 billion. Large-scale projects with large-scale foreign funds Brookfield plans to build a distribution center with a total floor area of about 130,000 pyeong at Wonchang-dong near Incheon North Port Port Complex. The ticket size is about KRW550 billion, and stabilized value is estimated to be more",

Pyeongtaek expansion Hwaseong, Osan, and Pyeongtaek are the preferred areas in Southwest due to their accessibility to metropolitan area through Gyeongbu Expressway and proximity to various Grade A logistics centers. A supply of large-scale logistics centers is planned around Pyeongtaek Port in the next three years. Representatively, a logistics center with a total floor area of about 69,4214 sqm is under development at hinterland of Phase 2-1 Port of Dangjin Port, Pyeongtaek. There are many small distribution centers in Gunpo and Ansan, originally developed as industrial complexes, and few Grade A logistics centers. Recently, Greybox Logistics Center located near Ansan Station was purchased before construction completed for KRW300 billion. It is newly built logistics center near Ansan Station in Gyeonggi-do owned by KB Asset Management as of H1 2022.

However, in the long term, investors' interest in logistics centers is expected to continue.” Logistics investment status Borrowing costs increasing with rising interest rates The biggest concern for investors in 2022 is rising interest rates. The Bank of Korea raised its base rate to 2.25% in July and has announced they are considering further rate hikes due to concerns about inflation. As the base interest rate rose, interest rate on loans also rose sharply. Commercial real estate mortgage loan interest rates, which stood at about 2% until 2021, rose to about the 4% level at the beginning of 2022, while the Project Finance loan rate has risen to 5%. As interest rates rise, investor sentiment is turning more conservative. In addition, investors are actively seeking ways to raise capital through equity rather than loans. 2022 logistics transaction volume expected to decrease YOY In 2021, the total logistics asset transaction volume in the Seoul Metropolitan Area recorded a new record high of KRW7 trillion. In addition, the sales price of logistics centers increased as more investment capital moves into cold storage assets. While logistics transaction prices per pyeong has been in range of KRW5 to 6 million since 2017, in 2021, logistics unit prices rose to KRW 8 million.

Moreover, Blue Cove Asset Management bought the partly- completed the Goyang Samsong Logistics facility, which consists of one warehouse and one cold storage, for KRW400 billion. The warehouse was completed in H1 2022, while the cold storage is scheduled to be completed in 2023. CJ Logistics is the major tenant. CJ Yongin Namsa Logistics Center, which is also one warehouse and one cold storage, was purchased by a blind fund created by CJ Korea Express and Samsung affiliates. AEW Capital purchased multiple logistics assets, including the Wonchang Logistics Center in Incheon, which is under development, and an additional facility in Ganam-eup, Yeoju, for KRW633 billion. Pebble Stone Asset Management completed the purchase of the Dongtan Logistics Center for KRW220 billion.

The cap rate used to be in high 5% range in 2019 but fell to the low 3% range in 2021 due to intensive competition for Grade A properties. An upward trend in the cap rate, which had been on a downward trend, has been observed since the second half of this year. From the beginning of 2022, when interest rates started to increase, cap rates flattened out, and have been flat since. This is in part due to increased logistics supply, and increased competition from investors. Simultaneously, the 5-year Korean Treasury Bond interest rate has risen sharply, and the risk premium spread has narrowed to be almost non-existent. In the future, we expect cap rates to rise and asset prices to decrease if the logistics center transaction size decreases followed by an increase in interest rates and construction costs. However, rising cap rates are not assured as sales prices have seen little decline thus far. Source: Colliers. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 BPS Spread Average",

From 2015 to May 2022, according to Statistics Korea, the Construction Costs Index went up about 46% to 146.38 from a base of 100. According to New Daily Economic News, cement prices have increased on average by 46.5% per ton compared to 2021. Rebar prices are also up 72.5% from 2021. In fact, contractors in the middle of constructing logistic assets are demanding increased fees due to rising construction costs. We expect rising construction costs may delay completion schedules to 2024 or later. Over the next two years, the pace of investment in new logistics center construction may also slow down as the cost of raw materials may be volatile until the current geopolitical instabilities start to subside. Therefore, investors need to manage the risk of rising construction costs when investing in logistics asset development projects. Reinforcement of regulations Various licensing requirements are being strengthened, including the regulations on the entry of freight vehicles into metropolitan area, a stronger Serious Disaster Punishment Act, along with stronger fire safety standards. Particularly, industrial sites closer to residential areas see more complaints from the community. Therefore, we believe it will be increasingly difficult to obtain new distribution center permits for sites close to residential areas. 12 Construction cost index Source: Colliers, Statistics Korea. 100 110 120 130 140",

Therefore, contrary to market perception, over the next two years we expect logistics center supply to be less than originally scheduled due to construction delays.” Judy Jang Director Colliers Research 13 Concerns about vacancy following increased cold storage supply In 2021, total sales of Coupang and Market Kurly, Ko ’ leading fresh food delivery platforms, increased by more than 50% compared to 2020. In the meantime, investments in cold storage have increased along with the expansion of fresh food delivery market. The reason investors increased their investments in cold storage facilities is because they could get higher returns as cold storage facilities have higher rents than warehouses. In fact, rent for cold storage is about twice that of warehouses. However, the tenant base of cold storage facilities is more limited than general purpose warehouses. According to Korean Government data, in 2021, the number of cold storage registrations increased 23% from 68 in 2019 to 94 in 2020. We infer about 14% of total logistics assets are cold storage as 75 out of 547 newly registered warehouses are cold storage. Investors sentiment pushed capital into cold storage as a way to compensate for the high cost of acquiring land with the higher returns offered by the higher cold storage rents. However, concerns about vacancy in Incheon, Yongin, Icheon, and Hwaseong is growing as large-scale cold storage facilities come online in these areas. “The risk of vacancy may increase for cold storage projects in the development phase that have not secured tenants. We expected an increasing number facilities will change their use from cold storage to general purpose warehouses.” 54 50 49 55 68",

Considering the massive growth in this sector over the last two years, analysis are asking how long can these e-commerce business continue expanding? According to data from the National Statistical Office, in May 2022, online shopping transactions amounted to KRW17.28 trillion, an increase of 10.5% from May 2021. In addition, the Korea Online Association forecasted the e-commerce market growth rate of will be 14.5% in 2022 and 13.7% in 2023. We expect the e-commerce sector to continue expanding, despite some initial signs of the growth rate slowing. Delivery volume continues to increase According to data from the Korea Integrated Logistics Association, domestic parcel delivery volumes soared from 2.7 billion units in 2019 to 3.3 billion units in 2020, and again increasing to 3.6 billion boxes in 2021. CJ Logistics, Hanjin, Lotte Global GS, Korea Post and Rosen Parcel, the top five domestic courier companies, accounted for more than 80% of the market. As 3PL companies such as CJ Korea Express, Glovis, and Pantos Logistics, which are major tenants of logistics centers, continue to grow, we expect the demand for logistics facilities to grow as well. As Coupang is reportedly planning to enter 3PL business, we believe competition from 3PL companies will continue to intensify competition for logistics center space.
