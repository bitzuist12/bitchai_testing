The region’s share of global FDI inﬂows also rose to 11.5 per cent in 2018. This trend is expected to continue, taking into account the dynamic industrial developments and improvement of investment and business environment in the region. Services sector is the largest recipient of FDI in ASEAN. The share of services sector in total FDI grew from 50 per cent in 1999–2003 to 66 per cent in 2014–2018, in line with global average. A signiﬁcant part of FDI in services ﬂows into ﬁnancial services, wholesale and retail, and real estate activities. This year’s ASEAN Investment Report features the FDI in the services sector, with a special focus on health care. The Report looks into foreign investments and the Multi-National Enter- prises (MNEs) in the healthcare industry in ASEAN, as well as the investment environment they thrive in. ASEAN is doing much to strengthen regional health care provision. Work on improving market opening and investment regime in health care is progressing, along with the implemen- tation of other related sectoral agreements and strategic action plans. It is worth noting that the demand for health care services in ASEAN and the corresponding need for investment in this sector are expected to increase rapidly in the coming years. This demand is driven by population growth, changing demographics, universal health",

Therefore, policies to support the development of private health care are necessary to complement public health care spending in order to keep up with the demand. The Report provides recommendations in moving forward to develop a competitive health care environment in the region. We hope that policy makers and stakeholders in the industry will ﬁnd the Report useful.

FDI rose from $147 billion in 2017 to $155 billion, with four Member States reaching new records (Cambodia, Indonesia, Singapore and Viet Nam). The region’s share of global FDI inflows rose from 9.6 per cent in 2017 to 11.5 per cent last year. Figure 1.",

Most of the increase was due to rising inflows from the European Union, Japan, Hong Kong (China), India and the Republic of Korea. The expansion was accompanied by a further increase in cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) after the jump in 2017. XVIII ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care The rise in manufacturing FDI was widespread across ASEAN Member States. The majority went to Singapore, Indonesia, Viet Nam and Thailand. The growth was part of the gradual shift of production capacity from China and elsewhere to ASEAN, caused by structural factors (the increase in relative labour costs in China) and accelerated by the United States– China trade tensions. Despite a 3 per cent drop, intra-ASEAN investment ($25 billion in 2018) was still the largest source of FDI, accounting for 16 per cent of inflows. However, this includes some investment originating outside ASEAN that was channelled through Singapore. Singapore remained the largest regional investor and Indonesia the largest recipient of such investment. Combined FDI flows to the CLMV countries rose by 4 per cent in 2018, to a record level of $23 billion, representing 15 per cent of flows into ASEAN. Companies from ASEAN, China and other Asian economies are shifting",
    "39": "production to the CLMV countries for cost reasons. FDI from the United States plummeted to just $8 billion in 2018, from $25 billion in 2017. This was in line with the global fall in United States investment due to the 2017 tax reforms. The FDI fall in ASEAN was concentrated in Singapore, where United States investment fell from $28 billion in 2017 to just $4 billion in 2018. However, United States FDI in manufacturing activities in ASEAN reversed from -$1.2 billion in 2017 to $12.4 billion, with significant increases in Indonesia and Thailand. Governments in ASEAN are encouraging the adoption of fourth industrial revolution technologies (e.g. industrial robots, artificial intelligence, data analytics, additive manufac- turing technologies) in industry, and promoting investment by start-ups and producers of relevant technologies.

ASEAN: FDI fows in manufacturing, 2016–2018 (Billions of dollars and per cent) 22 30 55 2016 2017 2018 83% 36% XIX Overview Private equity and venture capital firms are playing a significant role supporting FDI in ASEAN. The private equity and venture capital markets in the region are growing. Combined assets under management rose by 8.6 per cent, from $26 billion in 2017 to $28 billion in 2018. These funds support the growth of start-ups in the region, building future ASEAN MNEs. Governments across ASEAN have introduced initiatives to support the growth of start-ups and to foster investment, including by providing public-private co-investment opportunities and tax incentives. FDI into ASEAN is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by progress in regional integration, dynamic industrial development with new growth opportunities from production links with and shifts in production from China, and the improving regional investment environment. MNEs from many countries (e.g. Australia, Japan and the United States, as well as some from the European",
    "40": "Union,) have indicated plans to invest in or expand their operations in ASEAN in the next few years. FDI IN SERVICES The services sector is the largest recipient of FDI in ASEAN. The share of services in total FDI in the region grew from 50 per cent in 1999–2003 to 66 per cent in 2014–2018, in line with the global average, but much higher than the share of services in regional GDP (50 per cent). Such FDI rose from an annual average of $12 billion in 1999-2003 to $88 billion in 2014–2018 (figure 3) due to increasing investment in financial services, wholesale and retail, and real estate. These industries accounted for 78 per cent of FDI in services in 2012–2018. Figure 3.

This includes investment in holding companies, back-office activities, regional headquarters activities and distribution functions, which may support industrial activities throughout ASEAN but are classified as services FDI. The implication is that most FDI in other ASEAN Member States is in manufacturing. Services activities accounted for nearly three-quarters of M&As in ASEAN in 2014–2018. Cross-border M&As in services rose to a total of $43 billion in 2014–2018, from just $16 billion in 2009–2013. The growth in recent years is due in part to the relatively late opening-up of some services industries, given the strategic",
    "41": "or sensitive nature of the services sector. A significant part of FDI in services flows into segments that are connected to the development of the digital economy (AIR 2018), including financial services (e.g. for fintech, payment systems, e-readiness), wholesale and retail, and logistics (relevant for e-commerce). Financial services Financial services have traditionally been the largest recipient of FDI in the region, accounting for an average 29 per cent of FDI flows. The annual average FDI in the industry more than tripled between 2001–2007 and 2012–2018, from $11 billion to $36 billion. The top 50 banks of the world are all present in ASEAN. More than half have subsidiaries in at least four Member States, with nearly all having a presence in Singapore. ASEAN banks, although not yet in the top 50, are also expanding regionally. There is still significant potential to attract investment for the development of the financial sector with several markets underserved. Promoting investments in fintech has the potential to speed up development. Fintech firms’ development and regional expansion benefits from venture capital backing – both foreign and from within ASEAN. Wholesale and retail FDI flows to the wholesale and retail industry in ASEAN accounted for 16 per cent of total FDI inflows (or 24 per cent of services FDI) in 2012–2018. Investment into this industry amounted to an annual average of $29 billion in the last five years. Divestments, sales of foreign assets to local retailers, have been a key feature. About 70 per cent of FDI flows in this industry went to Singapore. Indonesia, the second largest recipient, accounted for an 18 per cent share. A majority of the FDI in this industry in Singapore is in wholesale trade, as MNEs and Singapore-based wholesalers operate regional logistics hub and coordinate purchases from there. Retail is an",
    "42": "intensely competitive industry in which major foreign MNEs have entered (and some exited) the ASEAN market. The majority of cross-border M&As are in this industry. The retail industry accounts for the largest source of employment in ASEAN, accounting for 16 per cent of the region’s employment. XXI Overview Intra-ASEAN investment has risen steadily in this industry since 2012 as ASEAN retailers have expanded in the region. In 2013, intra-ASEAN investment in retail was just $500 million. It rose to $1.4 billion in 2014 and reached $4.3 billion in 2018, surpassing all other major investment sources – making intra-ASEAN investors the largest source of FDI in this industry. Asian retailers from Japan, the Republic of Korea and ASEAN Member States have been actively expanding and opening more stores across the region. Many global retailers, such as Aeon (Japan), Alibaba (China), Amazon (United States), Carrefour (France), Lawson (Japan), Seven & I Holdings (Japan), Tesco (United Kingdom), Walmart (United States) are present in ASEAN, and they continue to expand regionally. New start-ups have also emerged in the retail industry, using technology to venture into the e-commerce space, contributing to the increase in retail activities. The 50 most- funded e-commerce start-ups in ASEAN had raised $12.6 billion as of July 2019, with most of the funding raised in the last two years. Many have raised venture capital to scale up operations and invest in other ASEAN Member States. Logistics FDI in the logistics sector appears small. The annual average value of FDI in logistics is less than $1.3 billion, or 1 per cent of total FDI flows in ASEAN in 2012–2018. However, FDI has the potential to significantly increase the efficiency of the industry as most domestic providers are small businesses. Over time, some foreign operations have been sold to local operators, leading to",
    "43": "divestment and explaining the fluctuations in FDI. There are several options for promoting more investment in the sector, including promoting logistics start-ups that serve niche markets (especially in last-mile delivery) and digital technology companies. *** The prospects for more FDI in services (financial, retail and logistics) in ASEAN are promising, with the rapid rise in trade volumes and industrial activity, improvements in logistics facilities and the growth of e-commerce. Growth will also be supported by regional agreements signed recently, and the implementation of the programmes of the AEC Blueprint 2025. The agreements include the ASEAN Trade in Services Agreement, signed in 2019, which builds upon the market liberalization achieved under the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS) and the ASEAN Agreement on e-Commerce, signed in 2018, which aimed to increase digital connectivity, and advance trade rules and strengthen the environment for e-commerce. XXII ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care INVESTMENT, PLAYERS AND POLICY OPTIONS IN HEALTH CARE Health care demand in ASEAN, and the need for investment in the regional health care market, will increase rapidly in the coming years. This increase is driven by population growth, changing demographics, universal health care programmes and the rise in the incidence of non-communicable diseases. Currently, health care expenditure in ASEAN accounts for 4 per cent of the region’s GDP, well below the global average of 10 per cent, and is expected to grow. In 2016, health care expenditure in ASEAN was $99 billion, equivalent to 1.3 per cent of the world’s health care expenditure. By 2025, it is expected to reach about $270 billion, more than the projected size of the region’s fast-growing internet economy ($240 billion by 2025). Policies to support the development of private health care are a necessary complement to public health care",
    "44": "spending, as the public sector alone is unlikely to fully meet this demand. Private hospitals are already important in some Member States in the region, accounting for more than 50 per cent of hospitals in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, and about one-third of hospitals in Brunei Darussalam, Singapore and Thailand (table 1). In other Member States, private sector participation in health infrastructure is relatively low but growing. Table 1.

The successful development of the health care industry depends on promoting investment not only in hospitals and care services, but across the health care value chain. This value chain includes health insurance, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment manufacturing, as well as new sectors such as tele-health and other medical technologies. Competitive local and regional industries in the health care value chain can help curb health care expenditures and support services exports. XXIII Overview Promoting investment in the health care value chain includes facilitating international investment. FDI in health care in ASEAN is still small, but it is rising and already significant compared to other developing regions. Greenfield investment projects in the health care industry within the region rose by",
    "45": "more than 40 per cent in the past decade, from an annual average of $1.4 billion in 2009-2013 to $2 billion in 2014-2018. Foreign investors from outside the ASEAN region are mainly pharmaceutical and medical device companies; 79 of the world’s 100 largest pharmaceuticals MNEs have operations in ASEAN. Intraregional investment in health care industries is starting to grow, involving a diverse set of companies and activities. Large ASEAN-based hospital groups and private equity companies are important investors in care services. The 15 largest hospitals with investment in the region are from Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. In pharmaceuticals, most global MNEs have subsidiaries in three or more ASEAN Member States involving multiple business functions (e.g. sales, marketing, manufacturing, R&D and regional headquarters). ASEAN-based pharmaceuticals firms are mainly contract manufacturers for global MNEs, but some are expanding to other ASEAN markets. Regional investment in the health care value chain also extends to small and medium- sized enterprises and start-ups. The 50 most funded medical start-ups, most of them based in Singapore, had raised more than $1 billion as of July 2019. Many of these start-ups, especially in tele-health and medical devices, raised funds to scale up and to expand in the region. Medical tourism has been a factor stimulating private investment in health care industries in some Member States. Medical tourism is rising in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, which have become significant destinations because of their high-quality and efficient health care services (table 2). Promoting medical tourism can have positive effects on the attractiveness of the market for private investors, due to its potentially higher returns. It can help finance better equipment and training and avoid the brain drain of highly qualified medical personnel – all with potential benefits for care services provided to locals, which should remain the primary objective.",

XXIV ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Investors identify three key challenges that are slowing the growth of regional cross-border investment in health care industries: (i) Hindrance factors related to the general investment environment. Complexities in regulations and administrative procedures for investors affect all industries. However, they can be more of a constraint for firms that are relatively new to international expansion and for small and medium-sized enterprises – both of which are common in health care. (ii) Differences in health care industry standards and regulations across ASEAN. The need for international investors in the industry to adapt to and comply with multiple regulatory systems to operate in the region adds complexity and increases costs. (iii) Skills shortages and technology weaknesses. The limited availability of doctors and skilled health care workers continues to weigh on the development of the health care industry across the region. The findings in this report highlight health care development priorities and possible investment policy initiatives. They include: (i) Universal access. This priority drives the need for more investment in hospitals; the complementary role of private investment, including through public-private partnerships; and the necessity to make the industry a priority for investment promotion agencies and to step up investment facilitation efforts. (ii) Affordable high-quality care. This priority drives the need to balance the development of private health care with appropriate regulation, to target the promotion of private investment selectively and to safeguard competition to keep prices in check. Appropriate regulation should consider the need to promote continued innovation",
    "47": "to advance the industry and improve efficiency in the delivery of care services. For example, regulations to ensure data privacy need to take into account development opportunities in digital health care services (e.g. tele-health and data analytics). (iii) Sustainable public expenditures and economic development benefits. In addition to increased private investment in primary care, this priority requires the promotion of investment in local production of pharmaceuticals and generics. It also implies incentivizing and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises and venture capital firms; promoting local ownership and local start-ups; and providing support for innovation, medical tourism and services exports. Medical tourism is an important mechanism through which development benefits can be gained. Development of the medical tourism market should involve an interplay of various stakeholders (e.g. private hospitals, government institutions, health care enablers, transportation and logistics services, the hospitality industry and tourism boards). (iv) Supporting the ASEAN regional cooperation and integration agenda. This priority requires seizing opportunities such as jointly promoting medical services in ASEAN and building on the relative strengths of Member States between financing, training doctors and XXV Overview nurses, and medical technology development. It requires removing or mitigating barriers to regional development in the sector, completing the implementation of the ASEAN Medical Device Directive (AMDD) and the Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) on health care services, and improving the transportability of health insurance. ASEAN is already doing much to strengthen the regional health care environment for investment. Work on harmonization and market opening in health care is ongoing under the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and the implementation of sectoral agreements and strategic action plans. Under the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS), ASEAN Member States have already relaxed foreign equity ownership restrictions in health care (table 3). The implementation of agreements including the AFAS, the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement",
    "48": "(which covers investment promotion, facilitation and liberalization) and the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (which aims to establish an integrated market and production base) has contributed to improving the investment environment for health care in the region.

Note: AFAS = ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services and commitments made by the ASEAN Member States at the mentioned rounds of negotiation. Although much work has been done in the MRAs and the AMDD, further standardization of approval processes for medical devices and pharmaceuticals as well as greater mobility of medical human resources is needed in order to build up ASEAN as an efficient medical hub. In moving forward to develop a competitive health care environment in the region, the following further policy options could be considered. Promoting public-private partnerships. Deeper engagement with private sector stakeholders – from hospital groups to private equity investors, and from pharmaceuticals companies to insurers – and mechanisms for regular consultation at the regional level could XXVI ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care help spearhead greater private sector participation in the development of the industry, including in digital health. One such mechanism could be an “ASEAN health care council” involving private sector stakeholders to promote the development of an efficient and competitive health care",
    "49": "environment. Considering an “ASEAN medical tourism hub”. The aim would be for Member States to cooperate and draw on each other’s strengths, skill sets and capabilities to develop the subsector. Such regional cooperation to develop comprehensive health care solutions could bring complementary benefits and synergies to participating countries, including in supporting the objectives of the AEC. Supporting digitalization and medical technologies. Member States could work on developing an environment that is conducive for venture capital firms, start-ups and health care innovators to establish operations in the region and develop digital and medical technology. Attracting MNEs and local investors and nurturing start-ups in this emerging area of health care delivery is important. In promoting digital or e-health, measures need to take into account regional agreements such as the ASEAN Agreement on Electronic Commerce. Jointly addressing skills shortages. Regional cooperation on MRAs such as on the services of medical and dental practitioners and nurses is important for addressing skills shortages, as they aim to facilitate the mobility of medical and nursing services professionals within ASEAN. There is a need to expedite the implementation of existing MRAs to achieve AEC objectives (i.e. free flows of skilled labour). In addition, health care providers in the region could foster close collaboration with other ASEAN and foreign institutions and centres of excellence (as is done by some hospitals in ASEAN) to upgrade medical standards and the skills of doctors and nurses. PART ONE FDI AND MNE DEVELOPMENT IN ASEAN 3 CHAPTER 1 FDI and Corporate Investment Trends 1.1. INTRODUCTION FDI flows to the region rose to $155 billion in 2018, despite a decline in global FDI. Global MNEs and ASEAN companies are investing in and expanding their activities in the region, further strengthening regional production networks and the region’s participation in global value chains. Steady economic",
    "50": "growth, the increasing number of middle-class consumers, a rapidly integrating region of more than 650 million people and a vibrant industrial landscape continue to underpin the attractiveness of the region for FDI. This chapter examines FDI trends and MNE development in ASEAN in 2018 and the first half of 2019. It highlights the investment activities of MNEs from within and outside the ASEAN region, their strategies, their regional expansion and their contribution to production networks. Rising private equity and venture capital investments, as well as investment in fourth industrial revolution (4IR) technologies, are also covered. The chapter concludes with an assessment of investment prospects. 1.2. FDI TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS FDI to ASEAN rose by 5 per cent to a record $155 billion in 2018 (figure 1.1a). This is the third consecutive year of rising investment in the region, with six ASEAN Member States receiving higher inflows,1 four of those at record levels (Cambodia, Indonesia, Singapore and Viet Nam). The sources of FDI have further diversified, with more companies from more countries investing in the region. 4 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care The increase in investment pushed up ASEAN’s share of global FDI flows to 11.5 per cent in 2018, from 9.5 per cent in 2017. Strong FDI inflows since 2010 have led to an increase in the region’s FDI stock to $2.4 trillion (figure 1.1b). In addition to strong intra-ASEAN investment, other sources contributed to the rise. They include the European Union (EU), Japan, Hong Kong (China), India and the Republic of Korea. The increase brought a record level of FDI to the manufacturing sector (the second consecutive year of increase, from $30 billion in 2017 to $55 billion) and further inflows to finance (from $39 billion in 2017 to $42 billion). Cross-border",

FDI by destination In 2018, FDI flows to ASEAN Member States were mixed. Six ASEAN Member States (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam) received higher inflows in 2018 than in 2017 (table 1.1). The four other Member States, however, witnessed a lower level of inflows last year. 1.2.1.1. FDI in six Member States The section below highlights FDI flows in the six advanced Member States and section 1.2.1.2 provides a detailed analysis of investment in the CLMV countries. Brunei Darussalam FDI in Brunei Darussalam rose from $460 million in 2017 to $504 million in 2018 due to a 42 per cent increase in investment from Hong Kong (China), to $669 million. However, FDI from traditional major investors (Malaysia and the United Kingdom) fell by 96 per cent, to just $21 million and -$343 million, respectively. MNEs in the oil and gas industry divested -$277 million, while investment in manufacturing rose from $493 million in 2017 to $701 million in",

Increases in manufacturing FDI (to $14 billion) and in investment in wholesale and retail trade (a 54 per cent rise to $7 billion) offset the -$6 billion divestment in mining activities. Strong intra-ASEAN investment and increased inflows from China, Japan and the United States supported the rise. Singapore remained the single largest investor in Indonesia, accounting for more than 48 per cent of total inflows. Malaysia FDI in Malaysia fell for the second consecutive year, by 13 per cent to $8 billion, mainly due to a 79 per cent decline in investment from other ASEAN Member States. There were some bright spots in the industrial distribution. FDI in manufacturing rose by 2.7 times to $4 billion and FDI in finance more than doubled, to more than $1 billion. The significant decline in investment in real estate, from $3 billion in 2017 to less than $1 billion in 2018, contributed to the lower inflows. Table 1.1.

Investment from Hong Kong (China) increased by 2.5 times, investment from Japan rose three-fold and investment from China surged, with a seven-fold rise. FDI in finance, real estate and other services rose, which compensated the decline in investment in manufacturing (to $1 billion); FDI to the power industry dropped from more than $1 billion in 2017 to $193 million. Singapore Inflows to Singapore rose moderately by 3 per cent to $78 billion – the highest recorded level. Singapore remained the largest host country in the region. FDI flows from the EU rose by 4.7 times to $18 billion, Japanese investment increased by 32 per cent to $5 billion and that from the Republic of Korea increased more than three times to $2.3 billion. FDI from other economies also rose, and they all compensated for the significant drop in United States investment (from $28 billion in 2017 to just $4 billion in 2018). United States MNEs accounted for 37 per cent of FDI inflows into the country in 2017, but in 2018 their share dropped to just 6 per cent. Despite the rise in FDI in Singapore, the country’s share of FDI flows in ASEAN continued to decline, from 62 per cent in 2016 and 52 per cent in 2017 to 50 per cent in 2018. Thailand Thailand witnessed a 65 per cent increase in FDI to $13 billion in 2018, building on the 186 per cent rise from 2016 to 2017. The rise was contributed by a considerable increase in FDI in manufacturing, from $2 billion in 2017 to more than $5 billion in 2018. The",

MNEs continued to expand in these Member States. Chinese and other Asian MNEs are shifting production to the CLMV countries for cost reasons and in some cases because of the effect of the United States-China trade tensions. Consistent with past years, Asian investors including those from ASEAN Member States, remained the major sources of investment in the CLMV countries. However, there are differences across countries. Chinese and ASEAN companies",
    "55": "were leading investors in Cambodia. They accounted for more than 51 per cent of inflows into the country last year. Chinese companies remained the single largest group of investors in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, accounting for nearly 80 per cent of total flows. In Myanmar, ASEAN remained the largest source of investment (59 per cent), led by companies based in Singapore. Companies from China and Hong Kong (China) were also active investors in Myanmar last year. Japan, the Republic of Korea and ASEAN were the principal investors in Viet Nam, contributing 63 per cent of investment in that country. Infrastructure, including construction and electricity generation, has been the largest recipient of FDI in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. In 2018, construction-related activities received the most FDI and investment in electricity declined significantly. Finance, real estate and manufacturing were the dominant recipients of inflows to Cambodia. Manufacturing remained the single largest recipient of FDI in Viet Nam, contributing to 47 per cent of all FDI in the country. In Myanmar, investors continued to participate in all three sectors (mining, manufacturing and services). Cambodia: FDI flows at all-time high, with growth concentrated in manufacturing and services FDI in Cambodia increased by 15 per cent to its highest-ever level ($3 billion), driven by growth in manufacturing and services (finance and insurance) (figure 1.2). Services accounted for 79 per cent of all FDI in Cambodia, while manufacturing accounted for 12 per cent. A significant proportion of manufacturing FDI is in the garment industry; however, MNEs outside of garments invest in a diverse range of industries, from toy manufacturing to electronics and automotive parts.

The decline was mainly due to a significant drop in investment in Singapore and Malaysia. Singapore and Indonesia were the two largest recipients of Chinese FDI, and they accounted for nearly 60 per cent of all Chinese investment into ASEAN in 2018. The overall decline mirrors the global fall in Chinese OFDI flows in 2018 as well as China’s policy of curbing Chinese OFDI in industries such as real estate, entertainment and sports (WIR 2019).

This fall in United States investment was global. The tax reforms introduced in late 2017 encouraged many American MNEs to move profits retained in their foreign subsidiaries, holding companies or regional headquarters back to the home country (UNCTAD 2018, WIR 2019). In Singapore, the drop in United States FDI was significant, from $28 billion in 2017 to just $4 billion last year. United States MNEs in financial services divested -$11 billion in 2018 (from $24 billion in 2017). However, United States investment in manufacturing increased, especially in Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. 1.2.3. FDI by sector and industry Strong FDI into the manufacturing sector (figure 1.10a) and three major services industries (finance, wholesale and retail trade, and real estate) (figure 1.10b) contributed to the record inflows in 2018 (annex table 1.1). They together received $130 billion in investment or some 85 per cent of total inflows in the region. There were important changes in the industrial investment pattern in 2018.

MNEs from ASEAN also divested (-$836 million). Most of the divestment took place in Indonesia. For instance, PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Indonesia) acquired a 40 per cent stake in Grasberg Mine from Rio Tinto (United Kingdom) for $3.5 billion and PTT Exploration & Production (Thailand) acquired a 22 per cent stake from Shell (Netherlands) for the Bongkot offshore gas field in Thailand, a joint project of the two companies, for $750 million.

The structural driver is the steady increase in relative labour costs in China, and now that shift has accelerated as a result of the effect of the United States-China trade tensions. The main beneficiaries in terms of manufacturing FDI include Indonesia, Thailand and the CLMV countries. There has been an increase in cases of foreign and Chinese companies establishing or shifting operations from China to ASEAN because of these reasons,7 with more firms planning to follow suit.8 More than one-third of the 430 United States companies in China surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce China and the American Chamber of Commerce Shanghai have moved or are considering moving production bases elsewhere to mitigate the effects of the higher tariffs, with 18.5 per cent planning to move to Southeast Asia (AmCham China and AmCham Shanghai 2018).

Another furniture company, UE Furniture (China) and Strategic Sports (China), a helmet production company, are planning to move part of their operations to Viet Nam to avoid the tariffs imposed on China.12 Electronics company Ricoh (Japan) moved its manufacturing to Thailand from China,13 and Kyocera (Japan) moved its manufacturing from China to Viet Nam, both to avoid tariffs. United States companies have also made such moves. Harley Davidson set up operations in Thailand to serve the ASEAN14 and China markets, and shoe company Brooks Sports (United States) moved its production to Viet Nam from China. Services sector FDI in finance reversed the drop seen in 2016–2017 with a rise from $39 billion in 2017 to $42 billion in 2018. The EU, Japan and ASEAN were the major investors (chapter 2). More than 80 per cent of FDI in finance in ASEAN last year went to Singapore. A significant part of that investment may be used to fund FDI activities throughout the region, given the importance of regional headquarters functions in Singapore. FDI in the wholesale and retail industry in ASEAN fell by more than $6 billion to $20 billion in 2018, despite increased investments from Japanese, Chinese and ASEAN MNEs (chapter 2). The fall was due to a -$9 billion divestment by United States firms (mostly funds repatriation), which had invested $4 billion in 2017. There was also a significant fall in FDI from EU firms, which invested $8 billion in 2017 but just $292 million in 2018. FDI in",

The rise in real estate FDI from Hong Kong (China), Japan and the United States made up for the decline in intraregional investment and in investment from China. Malaysia witnessed the largest drop in FDI in real estate, from $3 billion in 2017 to less than $1 billion in 2018. Real estate investment in Indonesia and Singapore also fell. 1.2.4. Cross-border M&As in ASEAN Cross-border net M&A sales in ASEAN rose by 6 per cent to $18 billion in 2018, contributing to the rise in FDI in the region (table 1.6). Companies from developed countries acquired considerably less assets last year. M&As from developed countries fell by 78 per cent to $2 billion in 2018, which contrasted with 2017, when companies from developed countries made nearly $10 billion in acquisitions and contributed to 58 per cent of total net M&A sales. However, a 126 per cent rise in M&A activities from developing economies, to $15 billion, pushed up the total value of deals in the region. This growth was due to a single megadeal by a Chinese company, which accounted for 65 per cent of total net M&A sales in ASEAN in 2018. Nesta Investment Holdings (China) acquired Global Logistic Properties (Singapore), the largest warehouse operator in Asia, for $11.6 billion. Aside from M&As by Chinese companies, intra-ASEAN M&As rose (section 1.3) and transactions by Korean companies doubled, from $316 million in 2017 to $630 million.

Singapore and Malaysia accounted for nearly 60 per cent of the number of deals in 2018 because of their relatively more mature M&A environment (figure 1.11). Indonesia and Thailand were the next most active locations for M&A activities last year. The number of megadeals exceeding $500 million was the same as in 2017 (i.e. 16 megadeals) (annex table 1.2). The megadeals explain that despite fewer transactions in 2018 than in 2017, cross-border M&A values rose. The $11.6 billion transaction by Nesta Investment Holdings (China) in Singapore was the main reason. In 2018, the 16 megadeals contributed to a total value of $30 billion, while the total value of megadeals in 2017 contributed $22 billion worth of transaction values. 3 1 5 Singapore Malaysia Indonesia Thailand Philippines Viet Nam Cambodia Myanmar Lao People’s Democratic Republic Brunei Darussalam 155 109 74 42 33 24 Figure 1.11.

Despite the decline, intraregional investment remained at a high level compared with the historical trend and is still the largest source of investment for the region. In addition to Indonesia, the CLMV countries continued to receive increasing attention from ASEAN companies. Regional integration, investment opportunities and the expansion of corporate activities continued to drive the growth of intra-ASEAN investments. Some large ASEAN companies continued to expand regionally with investment into multiple ASEAN Member States in 2018 and 2019. They include Axiata, Maybank and Leong Hup International (all Malaysia); Ayala, Pilmico Foods Corporation, San Miguel and Jollibee (all Philippines); Central Group, CP Foods, Gogoprint and Siam Cement (all Thailand); and Golden Agri-Resources, Grab, Keppel and Wilmar (all Singapore). ASEAN start-ups are also contributing to intra-ASEAN investments through their internationalization and success in fundraising to expand in the region. Intra-ASEAN investment is inflated by investments originating from outside the region channelled through Singapore. Excluding such conduit flows, the share of intra-regional stock drops by about one fifth (WIR 2019).

ASEAN investments into Indonesia rose by 15.7 per cent to $12 billion in 2018 (figure 1.14), driven by a 11.6 per cent rise in investment from Singapore to $10.5 billion.

ASEAN investment in Singapore, the second largest recipient of intraregional investments, dropped from $4 billion in 2017 to $3.4 billion in 2018, while investment in the CLMV countries (except Myanmar) rose. ASEAN companies continued to invest and expand operations in the CLMV countries mostly for efficiency-seeking and market-seeking reasons. Emerging opportunities have also attracted them to these countries. Intraregional investment by Thai companies recovered to $3 billion in 2018, after the fall to $2 billion in 2017. Companies from the Philippines have been actively investing, with an increase from $353 million in 2017 to more than $1 billion in 2018. That increase was also attributable to some large M&A deals.

INVESTMENT IN FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION TECHNOLOGIES Investment by MNEs and local companies in fourth industrial revolution (4IR) technologies (e.g. industrial and collaborative robots, artificial intelligence, data analytics, additive manufacturing technologies) is expected to grow in ASEAN due to increasing demand, ongoing industrial and business transformation, and the continuous efforts of ASEAN Member States to attract such investment. Governments in the region are encouraging the adoption and production of these technologies in industries and promoting investment by start-ups as well as producers of such technologies. The 4IR technologies are being applied and developed in the region through public-private partnerships such as in the development of smart cities, where MNEs provide technologies and participate in such activities. Companies involved in the development and adoption of 4IR technologies cover a wide range of industries (figure 1.16), including in the digital economy (AIR 2018). The increasing demand for 4IR technologies by industries is translating into more capital investment for upgrading of industrial facilities and new business activities. New investors in 4IR technologies are emerging, such MNEs or ASEAN companies associated with robotic service centres, cloud technologies, data centres, R&D and collaboration with governments in the region for the development of industries and smart cities. Private equity and venture capital firms are also playing an important role through funding ASEAN start-ups that are developing and operating",

PRIVATE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN ASEAN Private equity and venture capital firms are playing a significant and growing role in FDI in ASEAN. Private equity and venture capital markets are channelling foreign funds to ASEAN based companies. In addition, ASEAN based private equity and venture capital firms are also playing a role themselves in funding start-ups across the region – contributing to intraregional investment and building ASEAN MNEs. Venture capital funds have not been alone in helping ASEAN-based businesses to scale up. Growth capital (which supports expansion of relatively mature companies) and buyout funds also play a vital role in financing the growth of ASEAN companies and start-ups, such as in digital technology, business support services and health care activities (chapter 3). Assets under management Combined private equity and venture capital assets under management17 in the region rose by 8.6 per cent, from $26 billion in 2017 to $28 billion in 2018. This includes capital already invested as well as funds still available for investment. Of the assets under management, growth funds (for expansion or restructuring purposes by relatively mature companies) accounted",
    "121": "for the largest share ($12.4 billion) followed by venture capital ($8.7 billion), buyout ($5.9 billion) and other types of private equity funds18 ($1.1 billion) (figure 1.17). Each of these funds is an important source of capital for ASEAN start-ups and relatively mature companies looking for capital to expand. There has been a marked rise in assets under management held by private equity and venture capital fund managers. For instance, private equity assets under management grew by 5.2 times, from $3.7 billion in 2007 to $19.4 billion in 2018 (figure 1.18) while venture capital assets under management increased by 4.8 times in the same period (figure 1.19).

More than 230 global institutional investors are targeting the ASEAN region, with the vast majority aiming to invest in venture capital funds, growth funds and buyout funds. Intraregional investment accounts for 24 per cent of total investments into ASEAN-focused venture capital funds. Singapore is the largest source (48 per cent), followed by Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines (figure 1.21). In terms of industry focus, the top three sectors most favoured by investors are technology (83 per cent of investors), health care (65 per cent) and consumer services (62 per cent). *** Governments across ASEAN are integral to the rise of the private equity and venture capital industry in the region. They have introduced initiatives to support the growth of start-ups and foster investment in collaborative environments. For example, Singapore’s Startup SG initiative offers co-investment opportunities and tax incentives to encourage private sector funding. Indonesia launched the NextICorn Foundation to showcase the government’s commitment to facilitate start-ups in its domestic digital ecosystem. These two countries are home to six unicorns between them, the most in ASEAN. The Malaysian government established the Malaysia Innovation Policy Council to support digital tech initiatives in the private sector.

PROSPECTS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS MNEs and ASEAN companies continued to invest and expand in the region in a broad range of industries in 2018. Their investment and expansion activities helped push up FDI flows in ASEAN to an all-time high. A significant jump in manufacturing FDI and strong investment flows to financial services contributed to the rise. Active M&A activities in the region by MNEs and ASEAN companies have also help pushed up FDI flows last year. Even before the recent trade tensions and the shift in production, MNEs had been investing and expanding in the region to meet growing demand, upgrade in value chains (e.g. into R&D and retailing functions to support manufacturing) and join regional production networks (AIR 2014).

Their operations are contributing to increasing regional connectivity through intra- and interfirm activities. Investment into ASEAN is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by dynamic industrial development with new growth opportunities from production links with and shifts from China, and the improving regional investment environment. MNEs (e.g. from Australia, the EU, Japan and the United States) and ASEAN companies are expected to invest or further expand their operations in the region. This",
    "125": "sentiment is corroborated by various recent investment and business surveys (table 1.12). Many United States corporate executives with business in ASEAN expect their companies to increase investment in the region in the next five years (Amcham Singapore and United States Chamber of Commerce 2018). ASEAN is increasingly seen as an important market for United States MNEs in terms of worldwide revenue (Amcham Singapore and United States Chamber of Commerce 2019). Similarly, many European companies are also planning to expand their operations in ASEAN over the next five years (EU-ASEAN Business Council 2018). Japanese and Australian companies also have expansion plans in the region (JETRO 2018; Australia- ASEAN Chamber of Commerce 2019). MNEs surveyed in these and other studies perceive ASEAN as a region with high potential and an attractive location for investment. The factors include the rapid growth of the middle class, an integrating region of more than 650 million people, an improving investment environment, with commitment to infrastructure development and complementary location advantages that support regional value chain activities. The region is also witnessing rapid growth in several key industries, such as the automotive, electronics and retail businesses, and in the digital economy. Indeed, 85 per cent of European firms responding to the EU-ASEAN 2018 business survey see further ASEAN economic integration as an important consideration in their business success in the region. Manufacturing activities and the three major services industries (finance, wholesale and retail, and real estate) will continue to receive significant share of FDI flows – similar to the pattern witnessed in 2018. However, the Chinese government’s policy in curbing outward OFDI in real estate will have implications for Chinese real estate investment in ASEAN in 2019. Chinese companies are significant investors in real estate in the region. The rise in e-commerce and other digital-related activities in",
    "126": "the region will motivate more firms and start-ups to operate in the digital space, also attracting other service providers to ASEAN (e.g. logistics, packaging and fintech start-ups). Many start-ups in the region have scaled up or are planning to scale up their operations to neighbouring countries – further strengthening intra-ASEAN investment. Private equity and venture capital investments play an important role in funding the expansion of these start-ups. Such investments are rising in ASEAN with an increasing volume of assets under management, numbers of deals and numbers of investors as well as more ASEAN-focused funds. Investment in 4IR technologies in the region is growing because of increasing demand and the continuous efforts of governments in the region to attract and promote FDI in these industries. 59 Chapter 1 FDI and Corporate Investment Trends Table 1.12.

INTRODUCTION The services sector is the largest recipient of FDI in ASEAN and FDI in services in the region is rising. Building on AIR 2018 on the digital economy, this chapter looks at those services industries that are important for digital development (e.g. fintech, payment systems, e-readiness). 2.2. FDI IN SERVICES FDI in services rose from an annual average of $12 billion in 1999–2003 to $88 billion in 2014– 2018. The sector accounted for two-thirds of FDI flows in ASEAN in 2014–2018 (figure 2.1), in line with the global average, but much higher than the share of services in regional GDP (50 per cent).

Note: May not add up to 100 per cent due to rounding. Financial services FDI flows in this industry are mainly in Singapore, which alone accounted for 89 per cent of financial services FDI in the region. Many financial MNEs, in particular banks, and foreign affiliates of MNEs carrying out financial activities that are classified as financial services FDI, have established a presence in Singapore to coordinate operations across ASEAN and to provide financial services to clients based in the region. Many of the international banks from North America, Europe and Asia have had operations in the region for a few decades (section 2.4). Some have expanded by moving into new segments of the banking",

Singapore received 69 per cent, Indonesia 18 per cent, and Viet Nam and Thailand 4 per cent each of FDI flows to this industry in 2014–2018. In more recent years, Asian retailers (from Japan and the Republic of Korea, and intra-ASEAN) have been actively expanding and opening more stores across the region because of rising demand (section 2.5). In the e-commerce segment, key players are MNEs from Asia (particularly ASEAN and China) and the United States. Real estate and construction Strong industrial activity, steady economic growth, infrastructure demand and other factors contributed to the increase in investment in construction and real estate development of hotels, residential properties, and commercial and office buildings. ASEAN and Chinese companies are major investors in this services industry. FDI in real estate is widespread in 63 Chapter 2 FDI in Services the region although Singapore accounted for 45 per cent of the total. Other major recipients were Thailand (15 per cent), Viet Nam (13 per cent) and Malaysia (11 per cent). 2.2.1. Major services investors The leading sources of investment in services in ASEAN are the European Union, the United States, intra-ASEAN investment, Japan and China (table 2.2).

Taken together, the EU economies contributed an annual average of $17 billion in FDI in services or 19 per cent of all FDI in services in ASEAN in 2014–2018. Almost 30 per cent of services FDI from the EU was in financial activities. The second largest recipient of EU services FDI was wholesale and retail activities, and the EU was the largest source of investment in the wholesale and retail industry. MNEs from the United States invested an annual average of $15 billion in 2014–2018, or 17 per cent of services FDI in the region. More than 78 per cent of United States services FDI was in financial services. The United States was the second largest investor in wholesale and retail activities in ASEAN during this period. Intra-ASEAN investment in services over this period was significant. The annual average of intraregional services investment was $12 billion, which accounted for 13 per cent of services FDI. Of the three key services industries, intra-ASEAN investment in real estate stood out prominently, accounting for 29 per cent of FDI in this industry. ASEAN companies were the largest investor in real estate development in the region. Chinese firms accounted for 9 per cent of services FDI in ASEAN. The industry composition of Chinese FDI is different from that of developed economies. In particular, real estate and construction together accounted for 39 per cent of services FDI from China. Wholesale and retail trade and financial services each accounted for 25 per cent. Investment in ASEAN from Japanese firms contributed 9 per cent of FDI in services.

FDI in services by destination The composition of services FDI in 2014–2018 varies widely across ASEAN. Singapore remained the largest recipient of services FDI throughout the period, with more than 70 per cent share (table 2.3). The high share of services FDI in Singapore is due to its role as a regional investment hub and its hosting of many holding companies, back-office activities, regional headquarters activities and distribution functions, which are classified as services FDI (UNCTAD 2017). Much of this investment flows through Singapore and is subsequently invested elsewhere in the region, including in industrial (non-services) activities. Indonesia, Malaysia and Viet Nam accounted for 6 per cent each and Thailand for 5 per cent. The following subsections detail pertinent investment in each ASEAN Member State over the 2014–2018 period.

Brunei Darussalam FDI in services in 2014–2018 was mostly accounted for by inflows into the construction industry. A number of major projects started construction during this period. They include the $1.6 billion 30-kilometer cross-sea Temburong bridge, which started construction in 2014 and is expected to open in 2020. Investors in the project include China State Construction Engineering Corporation and Daelim (Republic of Korea). The ongoing construction of a major crude oil refinery and petrochemical plant, which started in 2017, is another major activity. 65 Chapter 2 FDI in Services This FDI project is a joint venture between Hengyi Industries (China) and the Government of Brunei Darussalam. Cambodia A series of investment activities in banking boosted services FDI in 2016 and 2017. They include the acquisition of an additional equity stake in Prasac Microfinance Institution by a foreign investor group, the acquisition of a 40 per cent stake in Phnom Penh Commercial Bank by Jeonbuk Bank (Republic of Korea) and the acquisition of an additional equity stake in Advanced Bank of Asia by National Bank of Canada. The rapid growth of the Cambodian economy has also attracted considerable real estate activities in recent years. Real estate companies from Asia, including from ASEAN Member States, were major investors. Indonesia Retail and infrastructure-related industries (including real estate) were the main recipients of services FDI in 2014–2018. Asian retailers such as Lotte (Republic of Korea) and FamilyMart (Japan) and Central (Thailand) have been expanding in Indonesia. FDI to the financial industry fluctuated, recording large net divestments due to local companies acquiring foreign",
    "136": "entities. The Indonesian tax amnesty programme between July 2016 and March 2017 contributed to the increase in local companies’ investment through such acquisitions (AIR 2017). Investment in real estate, such as the development of residential, commercial and office buildings, accounted for more than 20 per cent of services FDI. In infrastructure-related activities, foreign MNEs have invested especially in power generation. The Cirebon power station, for instance, was developed by a joint venture between four companies: Marubeni Corporation (Japan), Korea Midland Power (Republic of Korea), Samtan (Republic of Korea) and PT Indika Energy (Indonesia). In 2018, Power Construction Corporation (China) signed an agreement to develop five hydropower facilities in North Kalimantan, with an estimated investment of $17.8 billion. Power projects in the country have also attracted foreign MNEs, to provide engineering, procurement and construction services. Lao People’s Democratic Republic Electricity is the country’s major export, and FDI has played a major role in power generation in the country. Foreign investors have been actively involved in generating power for sale to the host country and for export to their home or neighbouring markets (section 1.3). For example, Ratch Group (Thailand) and Banpu Power (Thailand) have equity stakes in Hongsa Power Company, which operates a coal-fired power station in Xaignabouri. In 2017, Mega First Corporation (Malaysia) participated in the construction of the 260 MW Don Sahong hydropower plant. In 2018, Norinco International Cooperation (China) commissioned the 86 MW Nam Phay hydropower plant. It owns 85 per cent, and the remaining 15 per cent is owned by Électricité du Lao (Lao People’s Democratic Republic). Impact Energy Asia (Thailand) is developing Monsoon Wind Power, a $1.3 billion 600 MW wind farm project, the largest in ASEAN. Commercial operation is expected to start in 2021. 66 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on",

In 2018, Rosewood Hotels and Resorts, a subsidiary of New World Development Company (Hong Kong, China), opened a hotel in Luang Prabang. Minor International (Thailand) also opened a hotel in the same province. Malaysia FDI in financial services accounted for 43 per cent of all services FDI in the country in 2014–2018. Foreign banks have a large presence. Of 26 locally incorporated conventional lenders, 18 are foreign-owned banks.1 Major foreign-owned commercial banks include United Overseas Bank (Singapore), OCBC Bank (Singapore), HSBC Bank (United Kingdom), Citibank (United States) and Standard Chartered (United Kingdom) (section 2.4). The ASEAN Banking Integration Framework, once fully implemented, is expected to increase the presence of qualified ASEAN banks in Malaysia. The insurance and takaful industry has also attracted foreign investors’ interest. Metlife International (United States) acquired a 50 per cent stake in AmLife Insurance and in AmFamily Takaful in 2014. In 2016, Zurich Insurance (Switzerland) acquired MAA Takaful for $135 million, and in 2019 FWD Group (Hong Kong, China) completed the acquisition of a 49 per cent interest in HSBC Amanah Takaful. FDI in real estate was significant in 2014–2018, especially in the earlier part of the period. Lend Lease (Australia), a property development company, formed a joint venture with TRX City, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Ministry of Finance, in 2014 to undertake an urban regeneration project in Kuala Lumpur. The project is expected to be completed by 2021. Chinese MNEs have also invested in the development of real estate in Johor. Chinese companies such as Guangzhou R&F Properties and Greenland Group have investment in the development of residential and commercial real estate, and hotels. Myanmar The bulk of services FDI was accounted for by infrastructure activities. Over the 2014–2018 period,",

These industries together accounted for more than 50 per cent of services FDI in Myanmar. The government commitment to improving the country’s infrastructure and the increase in industrial activities are attracting infrastructure-related investments, including in power generation. Philippines Financial activities, power projects and real estate were major recipients of services FDI during the period. Nearly 40 per cent of services FDI in 2014–2018 was in financial activities. Foreign banks were expanding in the country, including through mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Capital One Financial Corporation (United States) opened a business process outsourcing (BPO) subsidiary in the Philippines in 2016. In 2018, CIMB Bank (Malaysia) expanded into the Philippines through a partnership agreement with CIS Bayad Center (Philippines) and FINTQnologies Corporation (Philippines). In 2019, ING Bank (Netherlands) diversified into consumer banking in the country and Credit Suisse (Switzerland) established a representative 67 Chapter 2 FDI in Services office for its wealth management business. M&As in financial services included the acquisitions of a 22 per cent stake in Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation by Cathay Life Insurance (Taiwan Province of China) in 2015 and a 20 per cent stake in Security Bank by Bank of Tokyo- Mitsubishi (Japan) in 2016. Singapore Financial activities accounted for 58 per cent of total services FDI flows in 2014–2018. Many foreign banks, holding companies and insurance MNEs have established a strong presence in the country (section 2.4). Singapore serves as a regional centre for financial activities, cross- border insurance and fund management. Of the 132 banks in operation in Singapore in 2019, 128 were foreign owned.2 Wholesale and retail activities received some 20 per cent of services FDI.

In addition to establishing greenfield logistic facilities and warehouses such as those of DHL Logistics, MNEs have been making acquisitions to gain quick access to logistical networks and facilities. Nesta Investment (China) acquired the Global Logistic Properties for $12 billion in 2018. In 2015, Kintetsu World Express (Japan) acquired APL Logistics from the Singapore-based provider of marine cargo handling services Neptune Orient Lines for $1.2 billion. Neptune Orient was acquired by CMA (France) for $2.4 billion in 2016. Singapore has also attracted many R&D activities of MNEs. MNEs such as Vice (United States), Mann+Hummel Group (Germany), 20th Century Fox (United States), TransferWise (United Kingdom) and Qualtrics (United States) have established regional headquarters there in recent years. In 2019, home appliance maker Dyson moved its global headquarters from the United Kingdom to Singapore. Google (United States) is building a third data centre, to be ready by 2020, and Facebook (United States) is constructing a $1 billion data centre, which is expected to open in 2022.3 In 2018, Philips (Netherlands), in partnership with Singapore Institute of Advanced Medicine Holdings, opened a regional oncology centre. Other R&D facilities have been opened recently by MNEs such as Agilent Technologies (United States), Archer Daniels Midland (United States), Continental (Germany), Evonik (Germany) and Mondelez International (United States). Thailand Finance and banking was the largest recipient of services FDI. The banking industry has attracted FDI from various countries such as Japan, China and other economies in ASEAN. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (Japan) acquired a 72 per cent equity stake in Bank of Ayudhya for $5.3 billion in 2013, one of the largest M&A deals in the country.

In the insurance industry, the presence of MNEs has been growing as restrictions on ownership have gradually been loosened. Since 2017, local insurance companies have been able to apply for permission from the Minister of Finance to have 100 per cent foreign ownership.4 Real estate was the second largest recipient of services FDI during the period, partly because of Thailand’s economic growth. Wholesale and retail activities were the third largest. Foreign MNEs have also invested in the telecommunication industry. Singapore Telecommunications owns 21 per cent of InTouch, which owns stakes in Thailand's largest mobile phone network, Advanced Info Service, and in satellite operator Thaicom. In 2014, China Mobile International Holdings (Hong Kong, China) acquired a 23 per cent stake in the communications conglomerate, True Corp, for $882 million. Viet Nam In 2014–2018, real estate received the most services FDI (28 per cent). As in other Member States, strong economic growth continues to drive FDI in this industry. In 2015, the government opened up the retail industry to allow wholly owned foreign subsidiaries.5 The market opening and the vibrant economy have attracted many retail MNEs to set up operations. Lotte Group (Republic of Korea), E-Mart (Republic of Korea) and ASEAN retailers have established networks of stores and supermarkets in the country. Some of these retailers are expanding in the country with more stores to meet growing demand. 2.2.3. M&As in services M&As are a more significant mode of entry in services than in other industries. Nearly three- quarters of total M&A values in ASEAN in 2014–2018 were in services activities (table 2.4). It is a preferred channel for gaining immediate access to",
    "141": "strategic assets, markets, networks and distribution channels. The growth is due in part to the relatively late opening-up of some services industries, given the strategic or sensitive nature of the services sector. Table 2.4.

Financial services were the main target. Business activities emerged as the single largest services industry for M&A activities (40 per cent), largely due to a single deal (the $12 billion acquisition of Global Logistic Properties (Singapore) by Nesta Investment (China) in 2018). The value of M&As in transport and storage (logistics) was subdued in 2009–2013 due to divestments (acquisitions of foreign-owned assets by indigenous companies) but rose markedly in 2014–2018, to $8.2 billion. Large deals such as the acquisition of Neptune Orient (Singapore) by CMA (France) for $2.4 billion in 2016 pushed up M&A sales in this industry. In information and communication, major developments occurred in earlier periods, especially in 2004–2008. Cross-border M&A activity in this industry peaked in 2007–2008. Some significant M&A transactions in this period include the acquisition of a 25 per cent stake in Binariang GSM (Malaysia), an investment holding company of mobile telephony assets, by Saudi Telecommunications for $3.1 billion in 2007; and the acquisition of a 41",
    "142": "per cent stake in Indosat (Indonesia) by Qatar Telecom for $1.8 billion in 2008. Since then, there has been a saturation of players and industry consolidation. ASEAN companies in services industries have also been acquiring foreign-owned assets in their home countries. Such divestments by foreign MNEs contributed to the fluctuation of investment flows and in some years to negative FDI flows. For instance, CP (Thailand) acquired a 64 per cent interest in supermarket operator Siam Makro (Thailand) from SHV Holdings (Netherlands) for $4.2 billion in 2013. Casino (France) divested from hypermarket chain owner Big C Supercenter in Thailand, by selling its 59 per cent stake to CP (Thailand) for $3.4 billion in 2016. CapitaLand Commercial Trust (Singapore) acquired the entire share capital of investment services provider MVKimi (Singapore) from BlackRock for $1.6 billion in 2017 and Oversea- Chinese Banking Corp (Singapore) acquired ING Asia Private Bank in Singapore from ING (Netherlands) for $1.5 billion in 2010. 2.3. DETERMINANTS AND MOTIVATIONS OF FDI IN SERVICES FDI by MNEs in services industries can be influenced by different determinants and economic considerations (table 2.5). A majority of FDI in services is motivated by market-seeking factors (e.g. market size, the growing number of middle-income consumers, economic growth and the benefits of regional integration) (Dunning 2003; Wadhwa and Reddy 2011; Zheng and Ismail 2019). These factors have been cited by services MNEs as reasons for investing in the region (AIR 2018, chapter 1). FDI in services may be driven by efficiency-seeking considerations (to lower costs of labour, overhead and administration) such as in information technology and business process outsourcing (IT-BPO). Some services MNEs have also expanded in ASEAN for a combination of efficiency-seeking and strategic reasons, such as to establish regional headquarters and to conduct R&D.

Real estate Market seeking CapitaLand (Singapore), Ayala Land (Philippines), Robinsons Land (Philippines), Cromwell Property Group (Australia), Goodman Group (Australia), Stockland (Australia) Economic growth and increasing demand for off ce buildings, residential properties and industrial estates have led to a rise in investment in real estate in most ASEAN countries.

Market-seeking FDI The large market of 650 million people in ASEAN, with a combined GDP of $3 trillion in 2018, is a major determinant in MNEs’ decisions to invest. ASEAN is today the seventh-largest economy in the world, and by 2030 it is expected to be the fourth largest after the EU, the United States and China. This growing market potential has encouraged many MNEs to expand their operations in ASEAN in a wide range of services industries such as finance, banking, retailing, and information and communication technology, as well as in the digital economy. ASEAN has also established free trade agreement arrangements with a number of partner economies, which include Australia, China, India and New Zealand – offering MNEs a larger market. Regional integration has increasingly become an important factor for FDI in ASEAN. This is because it creates a bigger market, opens up services industries to foreign investment, and promotes liberalization and harmonization of standards and qualifications that facilitate cross- border operations. A key determinant is the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), with its end goal of a single market and production base characterized by seamless movement of goods, services, investments, capital and skilled labour. Other barriers to trade, investment and services continue to be eliminated. Significant achievements in market liberalization and facilitation have been attained through the implementation of the AEC Blueprint 2015. In 2015, ASEAN formally declared the establishment of the AEC. In moving forward, the region has continued to implement major economic agreements, more trade and investment liberalization and facilitation measures, and sectoral programmes to further strengthen integration so as to achieve the end goal of the AEC: a more closely connected ASEAN. Recognizing the achievements of",

ASEAN’s regional integration has led to a progressive liberalization of services industries, improvements in the investment environment and increases in the transparency and efficiency of policies for businesses and FDI. Increasingly, MNEs and ASEAN companies have been adopting a regional strategy rather than independent country investment programmes (AIR 2018, chapter 1). The economic growth in ASEAN has attracted new MNEs to invest in the region and existing ones to expand and diversify operations. Some banks have diversified their services or expanded the spectrum of the value chain to offer wealth management services to the growing upper-middle-class population. Many insurance companies with a long-standing presence in ASEAN have also diversified their services coverage, including their geographical reach in the region. Driven by the large market potential, many retail and logistics MNEs have also actively invested in the region (sections 2.5 and 2.6). 72 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care The digital or internet economy in the region is growing rapidly. It is expected to grow by at least three times between 2018 and 2025, from $72 billion to $240 billion (Google and Temasek 2018). The extensive use of the internet and the rapid growth of the digital economy have attracted many services MNEs and start-ups to operate in ASEAN (AIR 2018). For instance, e-commerce companies Alibaba (China) and Amazon (United States) have cited the large market size and growth potential as reasons for their investments in the region. Some of the start-ups have grown to be regional players that invest in the digital or e-commerce space in other ASEAN",
    "147": "Member States. Some have scaled up and expanded their business activities along the value chain (e.g. from ride hailing to food delivery to health care and fintech) within their home countries and across ASEAN. The ASEAN Member States are committed to investing, upgrading and improving infrastructure in telecommunication, transport and power. Infrastructure investment needs in ASEAN are huge, estimated to be at least $110 billion per year through 2025 (AIR 2015). Infrastructure development in ASEAN has attracted the participation of many Asian, European and United States MNEs. For example, Tokyo Electric Power (Japan) invested in Viet Hydro (Viet Nam) in 2018 to grow its overseas business in hydropower projects.6 A partnership between China’s Huaneng Hydrolancang International Energy (51 per cent), Cambodia’s Royal Group (39 per cent) and Viet Nam’s EVN International (10 per cent) began developing Cambodia’s largest hydropower project.7 China’s General Nuclear Power Group acquired Malaysian energy company Edra Global Energy in 2016. Infrastructure development in power and transportation (including airports and ports) has attracted many related services companies to establish a presence in ASEAN to be near the centre of development and to win contracts. Some services companies need to operate close to major customers such as those in power project development, mining, and oil and gas activities. Engineering, procurement and construction companies and other firms that provide services to power and other infrastructure MNEs need to have a physical presence close to prospective clients. Similarly, in extractive or resource-oriented operations, mining equipment, technology and services companies are providing services to mining MNEs in ASEAN. For instance, Banlaw (Australia) provides services to projects in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, and Techenomics (Australia), an analyst of lubricants for mining machinery, has been contracted by companies undertaking projects in ASEAN. Some services MNEs such as banks and professional business services",
    "148": "(e.g. engineering and construction companies) have also followed clients to other ASEAN Member States. Thai banks have expanded into Cambodia and other neighbouring countries in recent years to serve Thai firms that have expanded to these locations. Similarly, Chinese, Japanese and Korean banks have all expanded across ASEAN to serve clients. The expansion of Samsung (Republic of Korea) in Viet Nam has encouraged many of its suppliers and service providers to follow the MNE to that country. The cluster of Korean companies in turn has encouraged Korean banks to establish a presence in Viet Nam to serve them. 73 Chapter 2 FDI in Services Liberalization of a host economy’s FDI policies constitutes a major “pull” factor. A study of 60 economies (including Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Viet Nam) found that reducing FDI restrictions by 10 per cent could increase bilateral FDI stocks by 2.1 per cent on average (Mistura and Roulet 2019). In addition to regional liberalization measures, the ASEAN Member States have also undertaken unilateral reform or further opening-up of industries for FDI, including in the services sector. Some of these reforms include amendments of investment-related domestic legislation, with the objective of creating more coherent legal frameworks for investment. Foreign and domestic investment laws are now unified in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam (OECD 2019). Countries in the region have also further improved business procedures, enhanced transparency and reduced the time needed for registration by using digital means of registration (Box and Lopez-Gonzalez 2017). This allows investors to track the progress made in the establishment and registration of new businesses. Efficiency-seeking FDI Some services FDI aims to enhance efficiency and lower overhead costs. Access to low-cost skilled labour (with language skills) is necessary for investment in BPO and IT services. Some",
    "149": "BPO companies have established operations in the Philippines to provide shared services for other companies within the group, while others have set up operations to serve third-party MNEs (AIR 2018). The BPO processes are usually standardized, which means that BPO MNEs can provide back-office support to other MNEs in ASEAN and around the world. Because of the availability of language skills and low-cost skilled labour for IT-BPO operations, the Philippines has attracted many such MNEs. Australian IT-BPO companies have invested in the country to supply BPO services, including call centre operations (AIR 2018). American and European MNEs have also established IT-BPO operations in the Philippines. Some Australian firms, such as QBE Insurance Group and the BHP Group, have established subsidiaries in the country to serve clients in their group. Citibank (United States), JPMorgan (United States) and other large foreign banks have back-office operations in the Philippines. These companies are also moving up the value chain in the BPO business by shifting from voice operations (call centres) into more complex activities and data analysis. Other countries in the region have also attracted BPO operations. In Malaysia, GlaxoSmithKline (United Kingdom) established a back-office operation, and Dell (United States) established its global business centre. ExxonMobil (United States) has its global business centre in Thailand. Shell (Netherlands) has business operations centres in Malaysia and the Philippines. Some locations offer MNEs opportunities to gain operation efficiencies, not because of low-cost unskilled labour but because of their geographical advantages, infrastructure development, efficient business ecosystem, skilled workforce, policy environment and other locational benefits. Such advantages facilitate investment in activities such as regional headquarters, logistics hubs and R&D. 74 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care There has been an increase in FDI in R&D activities and IT services in the region attracted",
    "150": "by the growth in the skilled-labour pool. Dyson (United Kingdom) opened an advanced R&D services facility in Singapore in 2017, while Motorola established its largest R&D facility outside the United States in Malaysia (AIR 2018). Samsung (Republic of Korea), which has a large presence in Viet Nam, is building a $300 million mobile R&D centre in that country. Some MNEs establish R&D subsidiaries in a host country to tap the local talent and knowledge ecosystem. Engie (France) opened a lab in Singapore as a regional hub for energy innovation and technology in Southeast Asia because of that country’s dynamic innovation ecosystem and regional connectivity. Yitu Technology (China), a facial-recognition software company, set up an R&D hub in Singapore to benefit from its well-developed artificial intelligence ecosystem and to strengthen the company’s capability-building processes. Some Member States (e.g. Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand) have also attracted R&D in pharmaceuticals because of strong industrial clusters, supportive policies and improving ecosystems that facilitate such activity (chapter 3). To coordinate business activities efficiently across ASEAN, many MNEs establish regional headquarters. These MNEs such as Alibaba (China), SK Group (Republic of Korea), Tata Consulting Services (India), Roche (Switzerland) and Pfizer (United States) have established regional headquarters for this purpose (mostly in Singapore). Synectics (United Kingdom), a provider of advanced surveillance technology and networked security systems, established a regional headquarters in Singapore to consolidate its Asia-Pacific operations. The company increases efficiency in serving customers in the region by bringing together all of its activities in one operational base. Strategic-asset-seeking FDI Most cross-border M&A activities are strategic-asset-seeking (sections 2.4.2 and 2.5.2). Strategic-asset-seeking FDI may be undertaken by acquiring target companies with strategic assets (e.g. reputation, brand name, knowledge advantage and laboratories) to aid in the development of the acquiring MNE’s ownership advantages.

    "151": "ASEAN Member States is facilitating acquisitions of strategic assets by MNEs. For instance, the acquisition by Alibaba (China) of Lazada in Singapore supports expansion in ASEAN through immediate access to Lazada’s market networks in the region. The acquisition by Mitsubishi UFG Financial Group (MUFG) (Japan) of a majority stake in Bank of Ayudhya (Thailand) provided immediate access to its networks and customers. Some Korean banks (e.g. Jeonbuk Bank and Shinhan Bank) have recently acquired banks in Cambodia and Viet Nam for strategic-asset-seeking reasons. Pilmico Foods Corporation (Philippines) acquired a 75 per cent stake in one of the largest agribusiness MNEs in ASEAN (Gold Coin Management Holdings (British Virgin Islands)), which provides Pilmico with immediate access to 20 livestock and aqua feed mills across 11 economies in Asia. In logistics, Kintetsu World Express (Japan) acquired APL Logistics in Singapore to gain access to its networks and regional facilities. 75 Chapter 2 FDI in Services Resource-seeking FDI FDI in services also involves resource-seeking motives such as backward integration or expansion of segments of the value chain. An example is electricity companies accessing resources (e.g. hydropower and coal) to generate electricity for sale to local markets or for export to their home market (e.g. a Thai electricity company generating electricity in another country for export to Thailand). Thai companies Ch.Kanchang, Electricity Generating, Natee Synergy and Bangkok Expressway are investors in a power plant in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic that generates energy for export back to Thailand. 2.4. FDI AND MNEs IN FINANCIAL SERVICES The financial industry plays an important role in the industrial development and services sector in ASEAN.

Although these companies do not produce goods and services, their regional coordination and corporate ownership functions have a significant influence on FDI flows in the host countries. 2.4.1. FDI in financial services FDI in financial services in ASEAN has fluctuated over the past two decades but shown an upward trend (figure 2.2). The annual average FDI in the industry more than tripled during that period, from $11 billion in 2001–2007 to $36 billion in 2012–2018 (figure 2.3). However, the share of the industry in total FDI remained stable at 29 per cent in both periods. Figure 2.2.

In 2009, following the 2007–2008 financial crisis, FDI in financial services plummeted to just $827 million – the lowest amount on record. Recovering from the European debt crisis in the early 2010s, FDI in financial services peaked in 2016 at $44 billion. In 2018, it fell marginally to $42 billion. M&A megadeals in some years (e.g. 2014 and 2018) also affected the trend because of the lumpiness of such transactions. Some foreign banks have divested assets, which were bought by local banks, also contributing to the fluctuating flows. This trend was consistent with the scaling down by many large EU and United States banks of operations abroad to restructure and manage risks after the 2007–2008 global financial crisis. Major Asian and ASEAN banks have demonstrated an opposite investment trend, as they have",

M&As in financial services Financial MNEs, in particular banks, are major acquirers of assets in ASEAN. In 2012–2018, the financial industry accounted for 30 per cent of M&As in the region and was the second largest target after business services (which consisted mostly of real estate). Given the strategic nature of financial and banking businesses, M&As are a preferred choice for market entry, especially for consumer banking activities, because they provide immediate access to established banking networks, branches and consumer bases. M&As in financial activities spiked in 2013 because of megadeals by MUFG (Japan), which involved a $5.3 billion acquisition of a majority stake in Bank of Ayudhya in Thailand, and by Sumitomo Mitsui (Japan), with a $949 million acquisition of Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional (Indonesia). There were 16 mega-acquisitions (over $500 million) of banks in 2012–2018 (annex table 2.1). These megadeals contributed to the fluctuation of M&A values. Nine of the",

MUFG alone made five such acquisitions in the period, including its acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in the Philippines Security Bank in 2016 and a doubling of its stake in Indonesia's Bank Danamon to 40 per cent in 2018. Home-grown banks are also acquiring the banking assets of foreign banks in ASEAN. In 2016, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (Singapore) acquired the Singapore wealth and investment management business of Barclays Bank (United Kingdom) for $320 million. In 2014, DBS Group Holdings (Singapore) acquired the Singaporean wealth management services of Societé Générale (France) for $220 million. Malaysia Building Society (Malaysia) merged with the Asian Finance Bank (Malaysia), which is owned by Qatar Islamic Bank (Qatar) and Financial Assets Bahrain (Bahrain), for $153 million. DBS Bank (Singapore) acquired the wealth management and retail banking business of Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (Australia) in 2017 for $79 million. 2.4.3. Banking industry specifics Some key features of the banking industry in ASEAN merit highlighting because of their implications for investment. Underserved population ASEAN is still relatively underserved by banks (figure 2.5), especially in the CLMV countries. Some 73 per cent of the region’s population does not have a bank account (KPMG 2016). Consumers in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam continue to rely on cash to pay for their goods. About 78 per cent of the adult population in Cambodia, 50 per cent in Indonesia, 66 per cent in the Philippines and 18 per cent in Thailand did not have a bank account in 2017. The size of the underserved banking segment suggests that there is scope for investment in banking, including the use of technology to reach the unserved in the region. 78 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Mobile",
    "155": "phone penetration The region has a mobile phone penetration rate that is higher than the global average. It is over 100 per cent for Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam, as some mobile phone users own more than one SIM card (Khidhir 2018). The scale of phone penetration also explains the increase in fintech investment in the region (section 2.4.5). Fintech development New types of service providers, particularly fintech companies, have emerged to compete with traditional service providers in offering financial services and solutions to customers, including payment solutions, loan applications, money transfers and remittances as well as robo-advisory and personal financial management services. Fintech companies can respond more quickly to changes in consumer demand and behaviour than traditional banks because they tend to focus on process rather than product innovation. Major banks and other corporations in the region are also investing in fintech by developing dedicated divisions and acquiring fintech companies or as corporate venture capital entities. 2.4.4. Multinational banks in ASEAN Regional growth, investment opportunities and saturated home markets are driving foreign banks to invest in ASEAN. MNEs from Japan have been actively expanding in the region to counter the low demand for credit at home. The significant presence of Japanese manufacturing companies in ASEAN has also encouraged Japanese banks to expand in the region. Similarly, Korean banks are increasing their regional presence because of the region’s market potential and the crowded market at home. For example, in 2016 Busan Bank opened Figure 2.5.

European and American banks were the earliest to establish a presence in the region. Banks from the United States, such as Citibank, have been in the region for over a century. HSBC (United Kingdom) has been present in Viet Nam since 1870. It was the first commercial bank in Thailand in 1888, entered Singapore in 1877, the Philippines in 1875, Indonesia in 1884, Malaysia in 1884 and Brunei Darussalam in 1947. As mentioned earlier, some American and European banks have scaled down or divested their operations in ASEAN since the 2007–2008 financial crisis. In recent years, European banks have been shifting their back-office processes or business process operations to ASEAN, with the Philippines being the main beneficiary. 50 largest multinational banks The top 50 multinational banks are all present in ASEAN.9 More than half of them have subsidiaries in at least four Member States (figure 2.6), with nearly all having a presence in Singapore (figure 2.7). Many of the top 50 have regional headquarters in that country. These banks include BNP Paribas (France), Deutsche Bank (Germany), ING (Netherlands), Société Générale (France) and UBS (Switzerland). The activities carried out by these banks vary.

Most of the largest ASEAN banks have a presence in multiple ASEAN Member States. Of the 25 largest, 20 have a subsidiary in at least one other ASEAN Member State (table 2.6). These 20 banks have combined assets of $2.4 trillion, equivalent to 80 per cent of the entire ASEAN economy in 2018. They provide a wide range of banking and financial services to clients, including financing of small and medium-sized enterprises. These banks include Bangkok Bank (Thailand), CIMB (Malaysia), DBS (Singapore), Maybank (Malaysia) and UOB (Singapore), all of which are present in multiple locations in ASEAN. Although Thai banks are not as internationalized as Malaysian and Singaporean banks, recently many have expanded to other ASEAN Member States, predominantly to serve their home clients overseas.11 Some banks, such as the UOB (Singapore), provide FDI advisory services to clients and are involved with fintech as well as venture capital funding for start-ups in the region (box 2.1).",
    "158": "Although some of these banks do not have subsidiaries in the rest of the ASEAN Member States, they nonetheless undertake services in those countries. Many have representative offices. For instance, Bangkok Bank has representative offices and branches in eight other ASEAN Member States, including the four CLMV countries, to serve Thai firms operating there (box 2.2). It has recently opened another representative office in Cambodia to meet increased demand from Thai companies.12 Figure 2.7.

Note: Many of these banks also have representative off ces and branches in other ASEAN Member States, in addition to subsidiaries. The trend of ASEAN banks entering wealth management services reflects a growing demand in this segment and shows that these financial institutions are diversifying the services they offer, partly in response to the growing number of high-net-worth individuals in the region. Many are also expanding their regional reach by digital means. For instance, Kasikornbank (Thailand) established a $30 million venture capital fund in 2017 to invest in fintech companies across Southeast Asia. Other banks such as UOB (Singapore), Maybank (Malaysia) and CIMB (Malaysia) are doing the same. 82 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Box 2.1. United Overseas Bank United Overseas Bank (UOB) (Singapore) is a leading bank in Asia, with a global network of more than 500 branches and offices in 19 countries and territories in the Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America. It is headquartered in Singapore and has subsidiaries in ASEAN (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Viet Nam) as well as branches and offices around the world (box table 2.1.1). The bank provides a wide range of financial services, which include personal financial services and private banking; commercial, corporate and investment banking; corporate finance; capital market activities; and treasury services. It also provides asset management, venture capital management and insurance services. Internationalization UOB has been actively expanding internationally since the early 1970s, when",
    "160": "it acquired stakes in Chung Khiaw Bank and Lee Wah Bank in Malaysia. It expanded to other ASEAN Member States such as Thailand and Indonesia. In 2018, the group further expanded its regional footprint by establishing a subsidiary in Viet Nam. It also started construction of a head office building in Thailand. Investment motivation Market factors (e.g. strong economic growth, market size, vibrant economies, rising incomes) and growing investment opportunities have played important roles in the group’s overseas investment decisions. The UOB group has invested and expanded in ASEAN to follow customers as they sought new sources of growth, more efficient production bases and additional revenue streams in the region. Operating close to customers and better serving them overseas were important considerations. Regional integration and the AEC are important determinants in the group’s investment activities in ASEAN. Facilitating FDI into ASEAN The bank established an FDI advisory service in 2011 – the first bank in Southeast Asia to do so – to facilitate clients’ expansion across borders. The bank offers one-stop solutions through nine dedicated FDI advisory centres across Asia, with partners comprising local government investment agencies, industry bodies and professional service providers. The centres have supported more than 2,200 companies in their regional business expansion and investment. In April 2019, through a collaboration with the Singapore Exchange and the China Chamber of International Commerce, the bank increased its support to Chinese enterprises wishing to expand into ASEAN. The tripartite alliance builds on UOB’s collaboration with the China Chamber to assist Chinese companies with their overseas ventures in the region. Through its FDI advisory services the bank is also assisting SMEs in seizing cross-border opportunities.

Fintech: Digital technology and players Digital technology has been contributing to the changing financial landscape in ASEAN. The emergence of new financial providers can lead to different responses from traditional banks. A 2017 Ernst and Young analysis of 45 major banks indicated that there are four main ways in which banks can engage with fintech companies (table 2.7). New and existing players are using financial technologies to provide alternative solutions such as for the unbanked or to serve niche markets. KPMG (2016) outlined two critical areas for fintech solutions. First, given the large number of migrant workers, low-cost money transfer solutions are required",
    "164": "for remitting money home. TransferWise, a European money transfer service, has launched an Asia-Pacific hub in Singapore to facilitate remittances. Grab (Singapore), a transportation network company, is planning to launch an international wallet-to-wallet function in 2019. Voyager Innovations in the Philippines is developing systems for conducting digital payments and money transfers, especially for overseas workers, using smartphones to remit money to their home countries.13 Second, fintech is being used to provide short- term loans for the small businesses that dominate the economies of countries in the region. Indonesian fintech firms have come up with numerous peer-to-peer (P2P) lending apps in response to the increase in demand and the lack of stringent regulatory control as yet.14 There is a need to address consumer protection and to catch up with innovative financial services in the P2P space. Table 2.7. Four main models of engagement with f ntech f rms Model of engagement Description Investment Banks invest their own capital in f ntech start-ups as: • Dedicated in-house venture capital or strategic investment arms • Independent venture capital funds • Investments on their own balance sheet Collaboration Banks enter into various types of arrangements with f ntech companies: • Using products or platforms developed by f ntech f rms (e.g., a bank teaming up with a robo-advisory f ntech service to offer investment management services) • Collaborating as a network to develop and test new technologies and solutions • Setting up referral arrangements, primarily in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending (e.g. a bank might refer a small business that falls outside its risk appetite to a P2P f ntech f rm) • Establishing joint ventures or co-created services (e.g., a bank partnering with a f ntech f rm to launch a digital marketplace) In-house development of products Banks are accelerating their in-house development of f",

Historically, they have been slow to create new products, given the complexity of their businesses and the strict regulatory and compliance environment in which they operate. Examples of innovation range from contactless payments and robo-advisors to a suite of e-banking products and services. M&A Acquiring a f ntech company can expand a bank’s digital footprint and short-cut the development of new technology. This is typically banks’ least preferred strategy, but large global and regional banks are taking stakes in online competitors. Source: Ernst and Young (2017). 85 Chapter 2 FDI in Services Foreign fintech companies also operate in ASEAN. Ant Financial (China), an affiliate of the Alibaba Group, is actively investing in the region.15 It invested in Thailand’s payment company, Ascend Money, in 2016 and formed a strategic partnership with Emtek Group, a leading mobile company in Indonesia in preparation for launching a mobile payment platform in that country. In 2017, Ant Financial bought a 45 per cent stake in Global Fintech Innovations Inc. (Mynt), a fintech business based in the Philippines, with the intention of sharing its digital financial systems with Mynt for the expansion of mobile payments in the Philippines. Fintech companies in ASEAN have also attracted investments through M&As. In 2019, PayU (Netherlands) acquired a majority stake in Red Dot Payment (Singapore) for $65 million.16 ASEAN fintech companies Although still in its infancy, the fintech industry is growing rapidly in the ASEAN region. Promoting investments in fintech has the potential to speed up development of the financial sector, given that several markets in the region are underserved. Over two-thirds of ASEAN fintech start-ups are less than five years old (Ernst and Young 2018). The 50 most-funded ASEAN fintech companies had raised over $1.7 billion as of 2019, attracting interest from venture capital firms",
    "166": "from the region (mostly Singapore), as well as the United States, Japan, China and countries in Europe. Most of this funding was raised in recent years, with about $1 billion or 60 per cent raised between January 2018 and August 2019 (annex table 2.3). A majority of the 50 most-funded ASEAN fintech start-ups operate in the payments and remittance solution segment and are engaged in lending, loans and credit. The other types of solutions provided by these fintech start-ups are financial exchange, investment tools and platforms, financial product comparisons, financial accounting and administration services. With a large and growing demand for such services, Indonesia is witnessing an increase in the number of fintech companies and start-ups. These start-ups are able to exploit niche markets that traditional financial services companies have been unable to serve. Although most of the top 50 fintech start-ups also serve customers in other ASEAN economies, only 42 per cent maintain a physical presence abroad (AIR 2018). Examples of those with a physical presence abroad include InvestorZ (Thailand) in Singapore, Acudeen Technologies (Philippines) in Myanmar, Omise (Thailand) in Indonesia and Singapore, and Coin.ph (Philippines) in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. Funding Societies (Singapore) has opened offices in Indonesia and Malaysia, and InstaReM (Singapore) has expanded into Malaysia. In 2019, wealth management fintech company Jitta (Thailand) expanded to Singapore; foreign exchange fintech Koku (Singapore) expanded to Indonesia and SME lending platform Validus Capital (Singapore) expanded to Indonesia. Fintech firms’ development and regional expansion has been underpinned by venture capital backing – both foreign and from within ASEAN. United States venture capital firms (500 Startups, Omidyar Network, Sequoia Capital) have invested in many ASEAN fintech companies. Other investors include companies from China (Ant Financial, Gobi Partners, GSR Ventures), Japan (GMO Venture Partners, Line Corporation), Australia (MC Payment, Square Peg Capital,",
    "167": "86 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Telstra Ventures) and the Republic of Korea (Intervest, Stonebridge Capital). European venture capital companies are also investing in ASEAN fintech start-ups (e.g. Chinsay AB (Sweden), Experian (Ireland), Ingenico Group (France) and Polychain (United Kingdom)). As the average fintech company in the region is less than two years old, most of the funding in ASEAN fintech markets comes from seed and angel investors (Ernst and Young 2018). Established venture capital firms tend to support mainly the larger, more established start-ups. 2.5. FDI AND MNEs IN WHOLESALE AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES FDI in wholesale and retail is market-seeking oriented, entering markets with potential for growth. One study estimated retail sales in just four ASEAN Member States (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand) to be $1 trillion in 2018.17 Sales are set to grow further with the increasing population. Although “wet” markets and family-owned shops are still the mainstay of the retail industry, the increasingly consumerist lifestyle in ASEAN is creating a market for modern retail chains, not only supermarkets and convenience stores but also luxury brand outlets. 2.5.1. FDI trends and pattern in wholesale and retail In 2012–2018, FDI flows to the wholesale and retail industry18 in ASEAN amounted to an annual average of $29 billion or 16 per cent of total FDI inflows (or 24 per cent of services FDI). About 70 per cent of these flows went to Singapore. Indonesia accounted for 18 per cent, followed by Thailand and Viet Nam, with 4 per cent each. A majority of the FDI in this industry in Singapore was in the wholesale trade, as MNEs or Singapore-based wholesalers operated regional logistics hubs and coordinated purchases from that country. In other ASEAN Member States, disaggregated data are not available; however, the share of",
    "168": "retail is likely to be much higher. This section focuses on FDI in the retail industry, an intensely competitive industry in which major foreign MNEs have entered (and sometimes exited) the ASEAN market in recent years. M&A transactions in wholesale and retail in 2012–2018 were worth $18 billion, of which more than 80 per cent involved acquisitions in retail. Another reason to focus on retail is its impact on host economies. The retail industry has been the largest source of employment in ASEAN (Chang, Rynhart and Huynh 2016). Some 45 million people, or 16 per cent of the region’s employment, work in this industry. FDI into the wholesale and retail industry has fluctuated over the last seven years (figure 2.8). In 2012, ASEAN attracted $38 billion of such FDI, but in 2013 the volume fell to $17 billion. This was partially because of acquisitions of foreign-owned assets in the region by local retailers. Divestment by MNEs from the Netherlands and acquisitions of foreign assets by local companies led to the drop in 2015. The fall in 2018, from $26 billion in 2017 to $20 billion, can be explained by a -$8.9 billion divestment from the United States, traditionally a significant investor in this industry. 87 Chapter 2 FDI in Services The major investors are from the EU, the United States, Japan, China and intra-ASEAN sources (figure 2.9). These five contributed nearly 70 per cent of FDI to the industry. Although FDI from most major economies into this industry has fluctuated over the years, intra-ASEAN investment has risen steadily since 2012 as ASEAN retailers have expanded in the region. In 2018, intra- ASEAN investment was the largest source of FDI in this industry. ASEAN companies such as Big C Supercenter (Thailand), CP All (Thailand) and Home Product (Thailand) as well as",
    "169": "conglomerates such as Sime Darby (Malaysia) have expanded in the region. In 2013, intra- ASEAN investment was just $500 million, but in 2014 it rose to $1.4 billion and in 2018 to $4.3 billion, surpassing all other major investment sources (figure 2.10). Figure 2.8.

M&As in wholesale and retail In 2012–2018, net M&A sales in wholesale and retail trade amounted to a net divestment of -$8 billion, whereas M&A sales in the services sector amounted to $50 billion. ASEAN retailers are expanding not only regionally but also domestically through acquisitions of the assets of foreign retailers (table 2.8). This phenomenon explains the increase in the levels of divestment in the industry in 2012–2018. Siam Makro, the Thai subsidiary of the trading company SHV Holdings (Netherlands), was acquired by local conglomerate CP in 2013. Casino (France) sold a 59 per cent stake in the Thai hypermarket operator Big C to TCC (Thailand) for $3.4 billion 2016. The total value of divestment deals in this industry over the 2012–2018 period was $11 billion, or",

MNEs in ASEAN retail industry Many global retailers, such as Alibaba (China), Amazon (United States), Carrefour (France), Tesco (United Kingdom) and Walmart (United States) are present in ASEAN, and they continue to expand regionally. Some have an extensive presence, e.g. Seven & I Holdings (Japan), Kering (France), Steinhoff International (South Africa), Sime Darby (Malaysia), Lawson (Japan), FamilyMart (Japan) and Shanghai Friendship Group (China). Nearly 75 per cent of the 50 largest retailers with subsidiaries in ASEAN have two or more subsidiaries in the region, and 19 of them operate in at least four ASEAN Member States (annex table 2.4 and figure 2.11). Despite being a small market in terms of population, Singapore received the most attention from the top 50 global retailers in 2018 (figure 2.12). The large population and growing number of middle-income consumers in Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam attracted many retailers to these markets. Figure 2.11. Top 50 global retailers in",

Petrol stations In Indonesia, most petrol stations are run by state-owned Pertamina, but foreign MNEs are gradually increasing their presence. Shell (United Kingdom-Netherlands) operates more than 70 stations under its brand in Greater Jakarta and Bandung. BP (United Kingdom) and local petroleum and chemical logistics company AKR formed a joint venture in 2017 to launch a petrol station network in the country. The joint venture capitalizes on BP’s retail experience and AKR’s extensive distribution channels.19 BP and AKR aim to open 350 stations by 2029. In Myanmar, PTT Oil and Retail Business (Thailand) and local conglomerate Kanbawza signed a contract in 2019 to open 70 petrol stations by 2023.20 China National Petroleum is also planning to open petrol stations in that country. Clothing and luxury brand retailers Fast Retailing (Japan), which owns the Uniqlo brand, has expanded rapidly in ASEAN. It has 209 stores in the region and has plans to open more in the coming years.21 Other fast fashion retailers such as Zara (Spain) and H&M (Sweden) have a presence in the region and are continuing to open more stores. Many luxury retailers",
    "172": "(e.g. bags, eyewear, shoes, clothes, watches and jewellery) have been expanding in ASEAN. Most are from Europe (e.g. LVMH Moët Hennessy-Louis Vuitton and L’Oréal (both France), Compagnie Financière Richemont and Swatch (both Switzerland), Luxottica (Italy) and Chanel (United Kingdom)). Furniture stores IKEA (Sweden) has stores in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, continued to expand in the region. In 2018, it opened another store in Thailand. In response to the growing spending capability of consumers, it plans to open one store in the region every year for the next five to 10 years. E-commerce MNEs from China are active in e-commerce in ASEAN. In 2016, to support its internationalization plans, Alibaba bought a controlling stake in Lazada, an e-commerce company founded by Rocket Internet in 2012, for $1 billion. In 2017, Alibaba invested another $1 billion, increasing its stake to 83 per cent. Also in 2017, it invested $1.1 billion in Tokopedia, the leading Indonesia e-commerce company, becoming a minority shareholder. Alibaba, in partnership with Softbank (Japan), invested further in Tokopedia with $1.1 billion in 2018. Other Chinese companies in e-commerce, such as JD.com and Tencent, also have operations in the region. Supermarkets, convenience stores and department stores In the supermarket, hypermarket and convenience store segment, Japanese retailers have expanded progressively in ASEAN. Japanese MNE retailers have been present in the region 91 Chapter 2 FDI in Services since the 1980s. Although their presence subsequently stagnated and then declined, Japanese retailers started expanding overseas again in 201622 as the domestic market became saturated amid intensifying competition. Aeon (Japan), formerly operated under the Jusco brand, opened its first store in the region in 1984 in Malaysia (box 2.3).

In terms of the number of outlets, its largest presence in ASEAN is through its convenience stores network, with 521 stores in the Philippines and 120 in Viet Nam. Aeon’s supermarket operations have successfully expanded into Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam. Aeon runs 127 supermarkets and 40 general merchandise stores in the region (box table 2.3.1). It has financial services operations in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and the Philippines. Its commercial real estate development business, Aeon Mall, has developed shopping malls in Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam.

The expansion of Japanese retailers in ASEAN is often facilitated through collaboration with local partners. The partners enable Japanese MNEs to access certain business advantages such as the availability of store locations or logistics facilities or sources for goods. Fast Retailing (Japan) has partnered in Malaysia and Singapore with Wing Tai Asia, which has an established track record in introducing leading foreign brands (Meyer-Ohle 2014). Among European supermarkets, Tesco (United Kingdom) and Carrefour (France) spearheaded the expansion into the ASEAN market. Carrefour set up its first hypermarket in Indonesia in 1998 and subsequently moved into other economies in the region. In 2010, however, it shifted its strategy and pulled out of ASEAN Member States in which it did not have realistic prospects of becoming a market leader.24 It divested from Thailand in 2010, Singapore and Malaysia in 2012, and Indonesia in 2013. Tesco entered Thailand in 1998. It took a stake in a joint venture to create the Tesco Lotus brand. It later expanded through the acquisition from the Thai CP Group of a controlling stake in Lotus. Tesco Lotus is now the second largest international business in Tesco’s portfolio and has over 1,700 stores. In 2002, Tesco entered Malaysia through a partnership with Malaysian conglomerate Sime Darby. Since then, Tesco’s presence has grown to include more than 50 hypermarkets. ASEAN-based retail MNEs are emerging. Thailand’s leading retail conglomerate, Central Group, has made several acquisitions in Viet Nam, including in shopping malls. It has also expanded into Indonesia. Other retailers such as Sime Darby (Malaysia), TCC (Thailand) and CP ALL (Thailand) (box",

CP ALL CP ALL was established under the Charoen Pokphand Group (Thailand) to operate 7-Eleven franchises after securing exclusive rights from 7-Eleven (Japan). It started with seven stores and has grown to a network of over 10,000. It also diversified to other brands and operates six other convenience store brands, two ready-to-eat and bakery services and a wholesale service, through its acquisition of Siam Makro (Netherlands), which it acquired in 2013 for $6.1 billion. It used that acquisition to expand across Asia, including to Cambodia, Myanmar, Singapore and Viet Nam.a In 2016, Siam Makro acquired an 80 per cent stake in Indoguna (Singapore), a meat and seafood company with a subsidiary in Viet Nam. In 2018, it further expanded its stores in Viet Nam. Siam Makro opened a subsidiary in Cambodia in 2016 and further expanded in that country in 2017 through a 70 per cent joint venture with local investors. In 2019, it opened its first supermarket with a $19 million investment.b In September 2018, the company set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Myanmar as it plans to open stores in the country in 2019 and undertake other retail and wholesale activities there.c Sources: Annual reports of CPP ALL and Siam Makro, and media reports. a Reuters, “Thai CP All shareholders approve Siam Makro acquisition”, 12 June 2013. b Khmer Times, “Makro to open Siem Reap supermarket”, 24 January 2019. c Siam Makro, Annual Report, 2018. 93 Chapter 2 FDI in Services 2.5.4. E-commerce: Digital technology and players E-commerce has been the most dynamic segment of the Internet economy in ASEAN over the past three years.

    "176": "most ($12 billion), and Thailand and Viet Nam each accounted for about $3 billion. E-commerce transactions in the region are expected to exceed $100 billion by 2025. The affordability of mobile internet, greater consumer trust in e-commerce and the growth of the logistics industry to handle e-commerce deliveries have been among the main drivers of this rapid growth. Many online retail companies have expanded their presence in ASEAN. In 2017, Amazon (United States) invested in Singapore to enter the region’s growing market, with a particular focus on Indonesia. DHL eCommerce (Germany) expanded in Thailand because of the high growth in e-commerce activities in that country. In 2018, Alibaba (China) extended its e-commerce activities concurrently in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Goxip (Hong Kong, China), a fashion e-commerce site, has been making further investments in Malaysia, after having established a presence there in 2016. Online retailers such as Zalora (Singapore) have grown rapidly without needing physical retail stores. Traditional retailers have responded by selling through online retail platforms such as Lazada Marketplace and the Go-Food platform (Go-Jek (Indonesia)) to leverage their online presence and market reach, or by developing their own e-commerce platforms. This new customer-centric focus has fostered a rapid increase in e-commerce sales in retailing. In ASEAN, e-commerce has been the most dynamic sector in the growing digital economy. The main shopping portals include Lazada (China) and Shopee (Thailand). As in the banking and logistics industries, new kinds of start-ups have also emerged in the retail industry, using technology to venture into the e-commerce space. The 50 most-funded e-commerce start-ups in ASEAN had raised $12.6 billion as of July 2019, with most of the funding raised in the last two years. Many of them raised those funds to scale up operations and to expand into other ASEAN",

In 2018, JD (China) led a Series C investment round in the Viet Nam e-commerce company Tiki. In September 2017, the company and Central Group (Thailand) formed a $500 million e-commerce joint venture.26 Other venture capital firms based in ASEAN, the United States, Europe and other Asian economies have been actively providing funding that supports the growth of the region’s e-commerce market place (AIR 2018). Start-ups such as Tokopedia (Indonesia) have benefited from such support (box 2.5). 94 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care 2.6. FDI AND MNEs IN LOGISTICS The availability of competitive transportation infrastructure is important to facilitate the movement of goods and people in ASEAN. Ports, airports, road and rail infrastructure is crucial for the development of an efficient logistics industry, which is needed to support the growth of industrial activities, trade and commerce in the region. The provision of efficient logistics services (box 2.6) can improve business efficiency and reduce transaction costs. FDI and MNE activities in logistics (movement of goods, management of storage and last-mile delivery in e-commerce) are expected to rise in light of increasing demand. Foreign companies are focusing their attention more on investing and expanding in ASEAN, including acquiring strategic assets to strengthen networks and establish footholds in the region. Logistics services could be provided by third-party services (outsourcing) or internally within a company (insourcing). The third-party logistics market in ASEAN is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.5 per cent over the next several years, from $36 billion in 2017 to $56 billion in 2025. Taking into account the share of companies’ internal logistics services, the total logistics market in ASEAN by 2025 could exceed",

FDI in logistics FDI in the logistics sector appears small, but that does not mean that logistical and freight MNEs are not active in ASEAN. As a proportion of total FDI, the share of the transportation and storage industry (used as a proxy for the logistics industry) in 2012–2018 was only 1 per cent but with an annual average value of $1.3 billion. During this period, FDI in the transportation and storage fell sharply (figure 2.13). Divestments by foreign MNEs contributed to negative FDI flows in 2014 and 2018. Box 2.5. Tokopedia Tokopedia is one of the top e-commerce companies in Indonesia. It provides its merchants with services that are needed for e-commerce transactions, such as logistics, banks and instant payment facilities. It provides same-day delivery and one-day shipping facilities, which involve a network of 11 logistics companies in the country. It plans to use artificial intelligence to predict demand and to extend the service to up to 90 per cent of its products in two to three years.a Tokopedia has successfully raised capital through various funding rounds from venture capital firms such as East Ventures, CyberAgent Ventures, NetPrice, Softbank Ventures Korea and Sequoia Capital (AIR 2018). It has also attracted $1.1 billion in investments each from Alibaba (China) and Softbank Vision Fund (Japan). With recent funding raised, Tokopedia plans to start acquiring stakes of up to 30 per cent in potential partners, including logistics companies and offline businesses, in order to scale up further.

For example, e-commerce activities require a shift in the type of storage needed, from simple warehousing to complex e-fulfilment centres where products are stored temporarily while orders are picked and packed, and shipped off to customers from all over the country, region or world. Speed, security and timeliness are key as online customers demand better services (e.g. immediate Box 2.6.

Key components of logistics services include core freight logistics services, related freight logistics services and non-core freight logistics services. Freight logistic services include transport by road, air, rail and ship. The United Nations Provisional Central Products Classification codes, which are used by all members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to schedule commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and by ASEAN under the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS), provide a description of core freight logistics services and related freight logistics (box table 2.6.1).

Efficient logistics services are thus important. Domestic logistics providers in the region tend to be small businesses that may not be the most cost-efficient owing to their lack of scale. Nor do these businesses necessarily have the capabilities to handle cross-border logistics, as they tend to be oriented to the domestic- market (Tham and Basu-Das 2017). The need for more efficient cross-border logistics services, lower logistics costs and new logistics requirements in e-commerce and the ability to meet increasing demand all present market-seeking opportunities for investors in the region. In places where local logistics companies are small and fragmented, international logistics companies have entered the market, targeting especially export-oriented businesses. APL Logistics (United States), DSV (Denmark), Panalpina (Switzerland) and Yusen Logistics (Japan) have established operations across ASEAN to serve export-oriented manufacturers. They provide a broad range of services, such as cross-dock handling, inland transportation, warehousing and distribution management, and customs clearance.

For instance, Samsung’s substantial manufacturing presence in Viet Nam has led to complementary investments by the company in logistics, to support the group’s supply chain management and export of its manufactured goods. In 2016, Samsung SDS, a subsidiary, established a joint venture with Aviation Logistics Corporation, a leading service provider in Viet Nam. In 2017, it established a joint venture with MP Logistics, with the aim of expanding its logistics business in that host country. The cooperation with these logistics companies is expected to help Samsung gain access to the Vietnamese cargo transportation industry and to facilitate Samsung exports from the company’s two Vietnamese complexes.

M&As in logistics M&As in logistics in ASEAN, though generally low, rose between 2013 and 2016 (figure 2.14). One megadeal, the $2.4 billion acquisition of Neptune Orient Lines (Singapore) in 2016 by Merit Corporation (Lebanon), significantly pushed up the value of cross-border M&As in the region that year. In 2017–2018, however, the number of cross-border M&As dropped notably as more local companies acquired foreign-owned logistics entities. Some examples of such M&A transactions: BTS Group (Thailand) acquired a 23 per cent stake in the Thai operations of Kerry Express (Hong Kong, China), Thai Beverage (Thailand) acquired a 75 per cent equity interest in Havi Logistics (Thailand) from the Havi Group (United States), Tasco (Malaysia) acquired Meriah Selalu in Malaysia from Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (Japan), and SM Investments Figure 2.14.

MNEs in the ASEAN logistics industry Most of the world’s largest logistics companies have a significant presence in ASEAN through subsidiaries, branches and representatives’ offices. More than half of the top 50 logistics companies with subsidiaries in ASEAN have at least six subsidiaries (annex table 2.6, figure 2.15). The top 50 are mainly logistics MNEs from developed countries (from the EU, Japan and the United States, in that order).

Some of these companies also have a physical presence through branches and offices. Not having a physical subsidiary in a country does not mean that logistics companies do not provide services to clients in that host country. A majority of international logistics companies have extensive networks and partnerships with local logistics companies or other foreign logistics MNEs, which enable them to transport goods for clients despite not having a subsidiary presence in a given location. The top 50 have a significant presence in five ASEAN Member States (Singapore, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia) (figure 2.16). Almost all of them have a presence in Singapore because of that country’s status as an international logistics hub. There are fewer international logistics companies in Brunei Darussalam and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic because of their smaller markets. International logistics companies can also serve these markets through logistic networks with partners that already have a presence in these countries. The availability of efficient infrastructure facilities and significant volumes of business are important investment considerations. CJ Logistics (Republic of Korea), through its logistics network, facilitates the transportation of goods in and out of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.

Most of the international logistics companies in ASEAN provide a variety of logistics services, covering transportation by air, sea and land. They also provide integrated logistics solutions coordinated by their subsidiaries in respective ASEAN Member States. For instance, UPS provides air freight services in five ASEAN Member States and brokerage operations in six. DB Schenker (Germany) provides air, land and sea freight logistics, and DSV (Denmark) provides transportation, warehousing and logistics solutions. DHL (Germany) and Panalpina (Switzerland) are delivering supply chain solutions in many ASEAN Member States. Kerry Logistics (Hong Kong, China) is engaged in third-party logistics, freight services, warehouse operations, and supply chain solutions in the region.

Logistics companies are using technology such as data analytics and artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of business operations. Many use automation and artificial intelligence to improve inventory management, including advanced inventory tracking systems for improving speed and accuracy and reducing delivery costs. Logistics start-ups are also active users of digital technology to serve niche markets, especially in last-mile delivery in e-commerce. These start-ups include Anchanto, an e-commerce logistics warehouse management system established in 2011 in Singapore. Anchanto’s clients include ASOS, Levi’s, Zalora and Flipkart.

Improving investment environment and liberalization The investment environment in the region is improving further with regional integration, increased industrial activity, economic growth and market liberalization. ASEAN Member States have taken national actions and under the AFAS are further opening the logistics industry for investment, with additional relaxations of foreign equity ownership restrictions (table 2.9). Rapid rise in trade volumes Trade volumes in the region have risen rapidly, from $0.8 trillion in 2000 to $2.9 trillion in 2018 (figure 2.17). This trend is expected to continue. Strong trade activity will drive more investment in logistics services to meet demand. Improving infrastructure facilities and increasing logistics efficiency As a result of improving infrastructure development from more investment (AmCham Singapore and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 2019) and the entrance of more logistics companies, logistics services in ASEAN Member States have become more efficient. Improving infrastructure plays an important role in attracting logistics investment. Rise of e-commerce The region is witnessing a rapid rise in e-commerce and internet-based business activity. Increasing use of mobile phones, the shifting shopping habits of young consumers towards the digital domain and the rapid growth of e-commerce start-ups in ASEAN are contributing to the rise in e-commerce (AIR 2018).

CONCLUSION The services sector is the largest recipient of FDI in ASEAN, accounting for two-thirds of all FDI flows in 2014–2018. That share will continue to grow as economies in the region become more service oriented. Nearly 80 per cent went to three industries: financial services, wholesale and retail, and real estate. FDI into these industries has continued to rise, attracted by the region’s growing markets, economic growth and developing internet economy. FDI in logistics, although small, is gaining increasing attention from logistics MNEs, including ASEAN companies. Many major MNEs in banking, retail and logistics are present in ASEAN. They are involved in different segments of value chains, by expanding into new locations and by opening more stores. Some ASEAN Member States are still relatively underserved by banks, especially in the CLMV countries. The size of the underserved banking segment suggests that there is scope for investment in banking, including the use of technology to reach the unserved in the region. Digital technology has also played a role in shaping the services industry landscape. Banks are making investments in fintech activities and in some cases have acquired companies with fintech capabilities. Digital technology has also brought",
    "191": "about new business opportunities that support the growth of fintech start-ups, which serve niche markets. The rapid rise in e-commerce has contributed to an increase in retail activities and in start-ups. In logistics, digital technology is being applied to improve efficiency in supply chain management, and the number of start-ups in this industry is also increasing. The prospects for services FDI (in banking, retail and logistics) are promising because of the improving investment environment, rapid rise in trade volumes, increasing logistics efficiency and demand, rise in e-commerce and emergence of new players. In addition, the rising number of middle-income consumers, the large population and the growing consumerism and regional integration will further increase the attractiveness of ASEAN for services investment. Further growth of FDI in services will be underpinned by the different regional agreements signed recently, and the implementation of the various programmes of the AEC Blueprint 2025. These agreements include the ASEAN Trade in Services Agreement (ATISA), signed in 2019, which builds upon the market liberalization achieved under the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS) and the ASEAN Agreement on e-Commerce, signed in 2018, which aimed to increase digital connectivity, and advance trade rules and strengthen the environment for e-commerce. Under AEC 2025, characterized by free flows of goods, services, investment and capital, the region will offer investors an even more attractive location for FDI in services. 105 Chapter 2 FDI in Services NOTES 1 Economist Intelligence Unit, Industry Report, Financial services, Malaysia, 2nd quarter 2019. 2 Economist Intelligence Unit, Industry report, Financial services, Singapore, 3rd quarter 2019. 3 Reuters, “Facebook to invest $1 billion in first Asian data center in Singapore”, 6 September 2018. 4 Economist Intelligence Unit, Industry report, Financial services, Thailand, 1st quarter 2019. 5 Economist Intelligence Unit, Industry report, Consumer goods and retail, Vietnam, 1st",

PART TWO INVESTMENT IN HEALTH CARE 109 CHAPTER 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN 3.1. INTRODUCTION Health care is an important industry in the services sector. It has significant implications for social, demographic and economic development. The health care industry encompasses the provision of medical care (curative, preventive and palliative), pharmaceuticals, medical technology and equipment, health insurance, research and development (R&D) centres and educational institutions. The health care expenditure in ASEAN accounts for 4 per cent of the region’s GDP, much less than the world average of 10 per cent.1 The provision of health care in ASEAN has traditionally been the responsibility of the public sector. With budgetary constraints, growing populations and changing demographics, the public sector faces significant challenges to meet current and future demand. The private sector, including foreign health care companies, can complement the efforts of the public sector in the delivery of care. This report focuses on private investment, in particular FDI and foreign companies in the health care industry in ASEAN. It does not cover public health issues or public investments in health care. The objective of this chapter is to analyse the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) and multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the development of the health care industry in ASEAN (box 3.1). The chapter examines the interrelationship between various segments of the health care value chain and the roles of different categories of investors, companies and stakeholders. It highlights the key features of the health",

The chapter also analyses the influence of the new industrial revolution and technological advances in the delivery of care and for private investment in health care. 110 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Box 3.1. Definition and scope of health care Investment in health care refers to all types of foreign investment (e.g. FDI, venture capital, private equity, non-equity arrangements), different modes of market entry (mergers and acquisitions (M&As), greenfield projects and joint ventures) and different channels of foreign involvement (e.g. technology suppliers, financiers, management contracts, knowledge or R&D collaboration) in the following segments of the health care value chain: • Health care infrastructure (e.g. private hospitals, clinics, specialized medical centres, diagnostic centres, nursing homes) • Manufacturing (pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and devices) • Application and development of medical technologies (digital technology, medical solutions) • Distribution and wholesaling of medical equipment, devices and pharmaceuticals • Insurance (medical insurance) • Other services supporting the health care industry (logistics, information technology and business process management (IT-BPM), specialized services) • Strategic collaboration and alliances such as in R&D, knowledge sharing and training 3.2. KEY FEATURES OF HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IN ASEAN Key features of the industry in ASEAN include the rapid rise in demand for health care services and facilities, the important role of the private sector, the growth in medical tourism (in some Member States), commitment to universal health care coverage and the improving health care investment environment. Rising population ASEAN is a $3 trillion economy and home to 650 million people, accounting for about 9 per cent of the world population in 2018 (table 3.1). By 2025, the population is expected to reach nearly 700 million and more than 790 million by",
    "195": "2050. The growing economy and population will drive more demand for health care services. Longer life expectancy and increase in older population The life expectancy in the region has improved over the past 15 years. In 1990, average life expectancy was between 64 and 65 years old. By 2016, the average life expectancy had increased to 73 years.2 By 2050, more than one-fifth of the region’s population will be over 60 years old.3 Longer life expectancy and an increase in the older population will have implications for the demand for health and for geriatric care facilities. Growing middle-class population and increasing chronic disease incidence The region is witnessing a growing middle-class population and affluent consumers who are more health conscious. In 2012, the middle class in ASEAN was estimated at 190 million 111 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN people.4 By 2020, that number is projected to more than double, to 400 million.5 The growing middle-class base means a continued rise in demand for health care and an opportunity for private investment in hospitals and other care services. Rising per capita income and changing lifestyles are contributing to the prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases, which requires long-term treatment and care. The incidence of chronic diseases in the region is expected to double from 2001 to 2025.6 Health care expenditure In 2016, ASEAN’s health care expenditure was $99 billion, which was equivalent to 1.3 per cent of world health care expenditure. Health expenditure per capita in the region was $113 in 2010 (table 3.1). By 2025, the per capita health care expenditure is expected to rise 3.2 times to $364.7 Health care spending in the region by that time is expected to reach at least $269 billion, more than",
    "196": "the estimated size of the region’s fast growing internet economy ($240 billion by 2025). However, the health care delivery market remains significantly under-penetrated and under-supplied, while demand continues to rise. Countries in the region thus face a significant demand as well as supply challenge (chapter 4). In 2016, ASEAN’s average health care expenditure as a percentage of regional GDP stood at 4 per cent. It significantly trails that of the world and developed nations (e.g. 9 per cent by Australia and 17 per cent by United States) and behind the average expenditure of East Asia and the Pacific developing economies (figure 3.1). This relatively low number suggests that there is scope for an increase in health care investment against the backdrop of increasing demand. Table 3.1.

Cost advantages, affordable and high-quality private health care facilities, and tourism values are key factors contributing to the growth of this industry segment. Notwithstanding the decline in the number of medical tourists to Singapore in recent years, the country remains an attractive medical tourism hub, especially for more complex medical cases. Rising costs in Singapore and better services in private hospitals in medical tourists’ home countries are the main reasons for the decline in medical tourism in Singapore. Other Member States such as the Philippines and Viet Nam are also receiving medical tourists mostly from neighbouring countries for better quality and affordable treatment. Figure 3.1.

Aside from affordable care services, these Member States have taken a combination of measures, which include targeted policy development, coordinated institutional support and cross-ministry and agency cooperation to support medical tourism with the view to strengthen the health care ecosystem. Growing private health care investment and services Private investment is a key feature and is significant across all health care segments in ASEAN. In some, such as hospitals and pharmaceuticals, private investment is rising. The private sector has been investing in and operating hospitals across ASEAN with different degrees of involvement (table 3.3). In some Member States, private hospitals account for more than 50 per cent of all hospitals or more than 20 per cent of hospital beds, while in others such as the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam, private sector participation is relatively low but increasing.

Universal health care coverage ASEAN Member States are implementing universal health care programmes for their citizens (chapter 4). For example, Indonesia launched a national health insurance scheme in 2014;9 previously more than 125 million people (more than half the population) lacked access to state health coverage, and state or private health insurance.10 In 2017, 76 per cent of the Indonesian population are covered by the national health care insurance. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Cambodia have partially implemented universal health care, covering about 12 per cent and 17 per cent of their populations respectively. Myanmar is implementing Myanmar Health Vision 2030 as a step towards universal coverage.11 Thailand has a successful national health care insurance to cover all citizens. In 2017, nearly 100 per cent of the Thai population are covered. Singapore’s Ministry of Health continues to develop and innovate its health care 114 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care system to provide additional primary health care and hospital services, intermediate and long- term care, and health care financing schemes (e.g. MediShield Life, CareShield Life, MediSave, CHAS, ElderShield) to ensure that its citizens have access to health care in a timely, cost- effective and seamless manner.12 The Universal Healthcare Coverage (UHC) of countries in the region in terms of access to essential service coverage",
    "200": "varies significantly (table 3.4). Some have high a UHC index, while others have a low index value. Health care value chain The health care industry in ASEAN differs in terms of quality and development across the Member States. This reflects the different levels of economic development, population size and social conditions of each country. Despite the diversity, private investment in health care in ASEAN Member States – domestic and foreign – is rising across the different segments of the health care value chain, with significant investments in health care infrastructure such as hospitals, diagnostic and specialized centres, and pharmaceuticals (figure 3.2).

VC and PE investments in health care The region has been receiving increasing attention from venture capital firms (VCs) in recent years. VCs are recognizing ASEAN as a hotbed for health care start-ups.Their investment in health care is rising, with most deals in hospitals and pharmaceuticals (table 3.5). Most of the funding has come from investment by ASEAN VCs or by VCs based in the region, mainly in Singapore. These investors include corporate VCs (e.g. UOB (Singapore) and Kickstart Ventures (Philippines)) that invest in health care start-ups. United States and European VCs are also active through their operations that are based in the region, primarily in Singapore. Table 3.5.

Figures exclude add-ons, grants, mergers, secondary stock purchases and venture debt. 3.3.3. Cross-border M&As in health care The value of cross-border M&As in health care in ASEAN is small. The lack of health care assets, the less mature M&A environment and the regulatory environment limits the number of health care M&As in the region. Small-value transactions and the lack of megadeals also contribute to the low M&A values. Most M&A transactions take place in the more developed ASEAN markets (e.g. Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand). Asian investors are major acquirers of health care assets or companies in the region. Hospitals, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment are the largest target segments for cross- border M&As (table 3.6, table 3.7). Most of the hospital M&A deals are by PEs. They are active investors in hospitals and home health care services. However, large hospital groups in ASEAN such as IHH Healthcare and KPJ (both Malaysia), OUE Lippo Healthcare and Raffles Medical (both Singapore), and Bangkok Dusit Medical Service (Thailand) have in past years acquired hospitals in other ASEAN",

Some health care MNEs invest in the region to exploit and internationalize their proprietary advantages. For instance, hospital groups such as Bangkok Chain Hospitals (Thailand), KPJ (Malaysia) and Raffles Hospital (Singapore) are investing and operating in primary care services in other ASEAN Member States to internationalize their hospital management expertise and to take advantage of emerging investment opportunities. In addition to market-seeking considerations, efficiency-seeking or low-cost production factors continued to attract pharmaceutical companies to produce drugs and medicines in the region to supply to local markets and for exports. Many of the major drug companies in ASEAN have continued to expand or reinvest in the region to increase production capacity and move into new business functions (upgrading in the value chain). The existence of capable local pharmaceutical companies to be contract manufacturers has also played a key role in improving the investment environment, which helps attract pharmaceuticals FDI. The size of the pharmaceuticals market in the region and the host country are important determinants. The commitment of ASEAN Member States towards universal health care provides opportunities for MNEs to produce and service local markets. Some MNEs or foreign entities have invested in the health care industry (e.g. hospitals) in ASEAN because of strategic reasons. They include non-health care companies, sovereign wealth funds (e.g. Khazanah (Malaysia) and Temasek (Singapore)) and pension funds",
    "208": "(e.g. the Thai national pension fund). They seek a return on investment or to invest in strategic assets in rapidly growing industries, of which health care is one. Non-health care companies or conglomerates invest in health care (e.g. Mitsui, Itochu, Sojitz and Mitsubishi (all Japanese)) to diversify their business portfolio or to seize investment opportunities in strategic health care assets in the region. PE and VC companies are involved because of investment opportunities in a growing industry. Some non-health companies, such as those in real estate (e.g. Rojana (Thailand)) and other industries (e.g. a subsidiary of Toyota) invest in health care by forming alliances and partnerships to establish a foothold in the health care markets of host countries. The availability of strong local partners has also facilitated joint ventures and strategic alliances by major health care companies in the region such as in the hospital and pharmaceutical segments. Many ASEAN health care providers, manufacturers and start-ups have internationalized. They venture overseas to grow, to seize investment opportunities and to diversify their geographical reach. The burgeoning pharmaceuticals industry in some ASEAN Member States also has attracted them to establish a presence and to be close to markets and customers. 121 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN 3.4. ACTORS OF HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IN ASEAN Foreign MNEs and ASEAN companies are significant actors in the region’s growing health care industry (section 3.6). They operate in different segments of the value chain (table 3.9). There are differences between them in terms of corporate activities, expertise and internationalization objectives. In hospital services, ASEAN hospital groups and PEs are major private investors. The pharmaceuticals and health insurance segments have a significant number of international MNEs, many of which have been in ASEAN for several decades. Table 3.9. Different",

It has a joint venture with Parami Hospital in Myanmar, which established Samitivej International Clinic at Parami’s medical complex in 2014. It opened a stand-alone medical clinic in Myanmar, through a joint venture, in 2016 to serve expatriates and the local population. Thonburi Healthcare Group (Thailand), through a joint venture, opened the $100 million 200-bed Aryu International Hospital in Yangon in 2019. 123 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN The CLMV countries have witnessed more FDI activity in hospitals and clinics in recent years, reflecting the improving investment environment and attraction of these countries. Emerging opportunities to establish hospitals and clinics are driving ASEAN hospitals (and foreign interests) to invest in these countries (table 3.12). Equity investments Some ASEAN hospital groups operate integrated businesses that involved other segments of the health care value chain (e.g. insurance, pharmaceuticals distribution and manufacturing). Some have established investment companies or holding companies abroad (e.g. in Singapore) with the purpose to undertake investment in hospitals and other health care activities in the region – adding to the complexity of their corporate structure (box 3.2). Large hospital groups, especially those with Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation for health care service quality, have also established representative offices in target host countries to facilitate medical tourism.

Key features and characteristics of ASEAN hospital groups The large hospital groups in ASEAN have similar features and corporate arrangements. Some of these features and characteristics include complex structures and multiple subsidiaries, and international partnerships and affiliations. Complex structure and multiple subsidiaries Some homegrown ASEAN hospital chains operate different health care brands that help them to target different segments of the market, both at home and abroad. For example, BDMS, the largest medical group in Thailand, has 45 hospitals and medical entities there as well as two in Cambodia (section 3.6.1). It has six hospital brands: Bangkok Hospitals (21 hospitals), Samitivej Hospitals (6), BNH Hospitals (1), Phyathai Hospitals (5), Paolo Hospitals (6) and The Royal Hospitals (2). The two Royal Hospitals are in Cambodia. BDMS is looking at other neighbouring countries for future expansion. The IHH Healthcare (Malaysia) consists of a network of hospitals and a few major brands (e.g. Mount Elizabeth, Gleneagles, Pantai, Parkway and Fortis). The two Mount Elizabeth hospitals in Singapore attract many medical tourists. The Parkway Pantai group of hospitals is mostly in Malaysia and Singapore. It has also acquired a significant stake in Fortis, which has hospitals network in India. Siloam International Hospitals, under the Lippo Group (Indonesia), has hospitals in the country under the Siloam brand. The group",
    "214": "has a health care presence in Singapore through OUE Lippo Healthcare, and through joint ventures it owns and operates hospitals in Myanmar. Integrated business and investment holding ASEAN hospital groups also operate integrated businesses involving distribution and manufacturing of pharmaceuticals as well as health insurance businesses. For instance, BDMS’s health care portfolio includes international pharmaceuticals business (manufacturing of sterile and generic pharmaceutical products and distribution), drugstores (retailing), medical devices and equipment, pathology services and health insurance. International partnerships and affiliations The major ASEAN hospital groups also have strategic investment interests with foreign partners. They have established alliances and partnership with major MNEs to supply pharmaceuticals, equipment and medical solutions. Some have also established knowledge collaboration in R&D activities, training and education. For instance, BDMS (Thailand) has partnerships with specialized medical centres and colleges in Japan, the United States, and Europe; Raffles Hospital (Singapore) is affiliated with the United States-based Mayo Clinic Care Network; Maayo Medical (Philippines) has Ottobock (a German medical technology company) as one of its partners; PT Siloam International (Indonesia) signed an agreement in 2017 with Philips (Netherlands) to supply, maintain and service health care technology and equipment in all of Siloam’s hospitals in Indonesia. These partnerships and affiliations are pursued for a number of reasons: (i) funding resources for expansion, (ii) access to markets, (iii) access to modern technology and specialized expertise or skills, (iv) patient referrals and (v) accreditation and recognition. Source: ASEAN Investment Report 2019 research. 126 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care In some cases, major local hospitals also involve foreign or strategic partners in their hospital operations. Examples include Ramsay (Australia) with Sime Darby Health Care (Malaysia) and the equity stake of Mitsui (Japan) in IHH Healthcare (Malaysia). Foreign health care institutions also get involved with ASEAN",
    "215": "hospitals through collaboration and strategic partnership in knowledge sharing, technological development, R&D and capacity-building. In this way, they contribute to the development of the health care industry in the region and connect with private health care providers in ASEAN. Aside from hospital groups, some ASEAN health care companies have also opened medical clinics and laboratories in other ASEAN Member States. They include Q and M Dental Group (Singapore) for dental care, Cordlife (Singapore) for health and allied services and Clearbridge Health (Singapore) in medical laboratory. Singapore Medical Group invested in Careplus Clinic Vietnam (a health care specialist services provider that focuses on health screening, women’s health, pediatrics and diagnostic imaging). Not all major hospital groups expand to other ASEAN Member States. Those from a home country with a large domestic market (e.g. Indonesia, the Philippines) have a limited overseas presence because they have chosen to focus on expansion at home. PT Mitra Keluarga Karyasehat (Indonesia), with 19 hospitals, and Metro Pacific Hospital Holdings (Philippines), with 14, do not invest outside the country. In contrast, hospital groups from Malaysia and Singapore have investments outside their home countries because of the limited market at home and as part of their business strategy to operate close to patients abroad. Some Thai hospital groups also established hospital facilities in the CLMV countries to serve patients there. Non-equity participation ASEAN hospital groups have foreign involvement in their hospital business through collaboration on hospital development, medical knowledge and technology issues. For instance, a network of hospitals owned by the VinGroup Corporation (Viet Nam) has foreign collaborations in oncology, cardiology, organ transplantation and hospital management. Foreign collaborators include UPMC Healthcare Group and GE Healthcare (both from the United States), Sanno Hospital and International University of Health and Welfare (both from Japan) and other foreign collaborators based in",
    "216": "France, the Republic of Korea and Singapore. Similarly, hospitals from Singapore collaborate and support the establishment of hospitals in Viet Nam; for example, Thomson Medical supported the establishment of Hanh Phuc International Hospital (Viet Nam). Thomson Medical co-developed hospital operational procedures and policies for nurses at the Vietnamese hospital. AJT Holdings (Singapore) manages the Singapore Medical Center in Cambodia under a partnership agreement with the owners. Other health institutions from European countries, Japan and the United States collaborate with ASEAN hospitals in R&D, in training and in sharing medical knowledge and experiences (section 3.4.2). 127 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN Mode of expansion ASEAN hospital groups have expanded abroad through a combination of acquisitions, greenfield investments, joint ventures and strategic collaboration. For example, IHH Healthcare (Malaysia) in its early years expanded its home-country hospital network through the acquisition of local and foreign-owned hospitals in Malaysia and abroad. It also built new facilities, such as the Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital and Specialist Centre in Singapore. Where opportunities for M&As are limited, ASEAN hospital groups have built new hospitals in host countries. BDMS (Thailand) built two Royal Hospitals in Cambodia. Wattana Medical Group (Thailand), through a joint venture, established the Alliance International Medical Center in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Bangkok Chain Hospital and a Lao investor entered into a joint venture to build the $70 million, 254-bed Kasemrad International Hospital Vientiane, which will open in 2020.14 Joint-venture arrangements with local partners are frequently used where local knowledge or networks of local partners are important and regulatory frameworks are continuously improving, such as in the CLMV countries. Samitivej Hospital, a subsidiary of BDMS (Thailand), expanded in Myanmar through a joint venture.15 KPJ Healthcare (Malaysia) has a joint-venture hospital in Bangkok and IHH (Malaysia) is",
    "217": "building a hospital in Myanmar. Several Singaporean health care groups have invested in the CLMV countries through joint ventures with local partners or other health care-related companies that already have operations in these economies. Singapore Medical Group in 2017 made a strategic investment in Viet Nam through an investment and management consultancy services arm (CityClinic Asia Investments). Its wholly owned subsidiary, CityClinic Vietnam, operates CarePlus Clinic Vietnam. Raffles Medical Group formed a joint venture with Singapore-registered AEA International Holdings, which operates the International SOS clinics in a few ASEAN Member States. Expansion through vertical integration Some hospital groups have also evolved to become more integrated through providing other health care services such as pathology and diagnostic laboratories, pharmacy, and manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and nutrition-based products. Raffles Medical (Singapore) operates medical facilities in 13 cities in Cambodia, Singapore and Viet Nam, as well as in China and Japan. It also operates medical laboratories, dental clinics, imaging centres and management consultancies. Raffles clinics in and outside Singapore have their own pharmacies, which sell its own manufactured health care products and those of other companies.16 KPJ Healthcare (Malaysia) has hospitals in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. In Malaysia, it has a network of clinics, assisted-living care facilities, health care universities and colleges, laboratories and diagnostics chains, and healthy meals facilities.17 Non-hospital investors Conglomerates and non-health care MNEs (e.g. banks, large Japanese trading companies) also invest in hospitals in ASEAN. Private equity companies seeking returns on investment have 128 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care equity stakes in or own hospitals in different ASEAN Member States. These PE companies operating in the region and with investment in hospitals include Columbia (United States), Quadria Capital (Singapore), Navis Capital (Malaysia) and TE Asia Healthcare (Singapore). Bowsprit Capital (Singapore) acquired two hospitals",

Foreign health care providers and MNEs Foreign companies have entered the ASEAN market in hospital operations through various approaches, including acquisitions, taking up strategic stakes and collaborations (table 3.13). For example, the Australian health care group, Ramsay Health Care, owns and operates seven facilities in ASEAN through joint-venture arrangements with Sime Darby (Malaysia). The joint-venture entity, Ramsay Sime Darby Health Care (Malaysia), operates three hospitals in Indonesia, and three hospitals and a nursing college in Malaysia. International Columbia (United States), through Columbia Asia Healthcare, headquartered in Malaysia, owns and manages medical facilities in Indonesia (3), Malaysia (12) and Viet Nam (3) (section 3.6.1). Columbia Asia Healthcare oversees International Columbia’s health care interests in Southeast Asia. Capital Medica (Japan) tied up with Sojitz Corporation (Japan) is expanding in ASEAN (section 3.6.1). In 2015, Capital Medica-Sojitz entered into a partnership with TMMC Healthcare (Viet Nam) to focus on training for medical and supporting staff, research and technology, and development of medical centres. TMMC Healthcare has four general hospitals, one polyclinic and one medical college in Viet Nam. 3.4.2.1. Japanese MNEs Health care investment from Japan in ASEAN is small but rising, with growing interest by Japanese institutions and companies to participate in various segments of the health care value chain (figure 3.4). Japanese companies are involved in health care in the region through equity and non-equity forms of participation and with different business functions (e.g. provision of health care services, retailing and distribution, manufacturing, R&D, knowledge collaboration and regional headquarters activities). Encouragement of such participation by the Government of Japan through measures that support Japanese health care-related institutions and companies to provide services overseas also played a role in this investment development in ASEAN (AIR 2018).

Other Japanese hospitals, including Happy International Hospital and Japan International Eye Hospital, have invested in and owned medical facilities in Viet Nam. The rise of the health care industry in ASEAN has attracted Japanese pharmaceutical companies to invest and expand in the region. Toho Pharmaceutical, one of Japan’s leading pharmaceutical wholesalers, built a medication production factory in Hanoi. Toho Holdings entered into an agreement in 2018 with Pharmaniaga (Malaysia) to expand pharmaceuticals distribution and business development in Malaysia. Nipro Pharma Corporation, Japan’s biggest prescription drug contract manufacturer, expanded in Viet Nam. Fuji Pharma acquired OLIC (one of the largest pharmaceutical contract manufacturers in Thailand) from DKSH (Switzerland) in 2012 and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma with a presence in Singapore established a subsidiary (Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals) in Thailand in 2019. Some Japanese companies have also invested in health care institutions in ASEAN, including training of health workers; some of these workers are later sent to Japan (e.g. St. Frances Cabrini Medical Center in the Philippines). Japanese health care companies with",
    "223": "nursing care expertise look for opportunities to expand aboard, including in ASEAN, to better exploit their experience and management know-how in such business operation. In tapping the growing demand for health care services in ASEAN, some medical services companies and hospitals from Japan have established representatives in offices in the region. For example, IMS International Medical Support opened a medical service support company in Hanoi in April 2019 with two major Japanese health care companies (I-cell Networks and Assam Company). The joint-venture company provides information, counselling and support services for Vietnamese patients wishing to travel to Japan for examination and treatment. It also provides health care services and coordinates with Vinmec Hospital and Thong Nhat Hospital in Viet Nam after patients return home.18 3.4.2.2. European MNEs The European health-related MNEs in ASEAN are concentrated in the pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and health insurance segments. A few European hospitals operate in the CLMV countries (e.g. in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and in Viet Nam). Two major international standard hospitals in Viet Nam (L’Hôpital Français de Hanoi and Franco- Vietnamese Hospital in Ho Chi Minh) are owned and managed by French companies and doctors. Franco-Vietnamese Hospital is 100 per cent foreign-owned by Medical Founders Holding (Hong Kong, China), the company of the French founders, and by Quadria Capital, a PE company based in Singapore. Many European pharmaceuticals and equipment manufacturers operate in ASEAN with multiple subsidiaries and in different ASEAN Member States. They include AstraZeneca (United Kingdom), Bayer (Germany), Mylan (Netherlands), Novartis (Switzerland), Novo Nordisk (Denmark) and Solvay (Belgium) (section 3.4.3).

European MNEs also supply equipment and medical technology and solutions to many hospitals and health care providers in ASEAN through their agents and sales subsidiaries. Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare Group, through its hospital chains, procures medical solutions and equipment from Karl Storz (Germany), Siemens Healthcare (Germany), Royal Philips (Netherlands) and Elekta (Sweden). BDMS (Thailand) collaborates with various European hospitals in specialized fields of expertise (e.g. Straumann Group (Switzerland) and Hannover Medical School (Germany)). 3.4.2.3. United States MNEs United States MNEs are present in ASEAN mainly as health care funds, PE companies, and in the pharmaceuticals, insurance, and medical technology and equipment segments. PE companies such as International Columbia, through its subsidiary in Malaysia, have a significant presence in hospital operation in the region (section 3.6.1). Pharmaceutical companies (e.g. Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, and Eli Lilly) have operations in multiple ASEAN Member States in the manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Some United States MNEs also export pharmaceutical products from ASEAN to third countries. United States medical equipment manufacturers such as GE Healthcare and Boston Scientific have a significant presence in the region.

The rapid growth of pharmaceuticals in Viet Nam is contributing to the increase in FDI in the country in recent years. The country’s pharmaceuticals market is forecast to double, from $3.3 billion in 2015 to $6.6 billion in 2020.a The penetration of foreign pharmaceutical groups such as Sanofi (France), Taisho (Japan) and Abbott (United States) in Viet Nam is putting pressure on local companies and at the same time expanding supply in the host market. The government is encouraging domestic drug manufacturing to reduce reliance on imported drugs (particularly patented ones). This is one of the reasons behind the decision of Taisho (Japan) to scale up engagement in Viet Nam. It acquired a 24.4 per cent stake in Hau Giang Pharmaceutical JSC (DHG) (Viet Nam) in 2016. The equity stake and alliance with DHG enable the partners to share knowledge, technology and experience in the pharmaceuticals business. In 2016, Abbott (United States) acquired Glomed Pharmaceutical Company, a leading Vietnamese drug manufacturer. Nipro Pharma Corporation (Japan) built a $150 million manufacturing plant in Haiphong, which started operation in 2015 and expanded in 2017 in the Saigon Hi-Tech Park to increase capacity to meet growing local demand for medical equipment. The expansion project also focuses on R&D activities. Sanofi (France) has been in Viet Nam for about 50 years; it is the third-largest market for Sanofi, after India and Indonesia. In 2015, Sanofi constructed its third plant in the Saigon High-Tech Park to expand capacity. About 80 per cent of Sanofi’s manufactures are sold domestically and the rest exported to other Asian countries. Sanofi also established a strategic partnership with Vinapharm (Viet Nam) in 2017.

The region is also a clinical test base for many of the pharmaceutical players. Member States such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand are recognized as emerging clinical trial markets (Ali et al. 2018). Chembio Diagnostics (United States) acquired RVR Diagnostics (Malaysia), which provides point-of-care diagnostic tests for infectious diseases, for $3.5 million in 2017.22 TPG Capital Asia (ultimate parent in United States) acquired Quest Laboratories, a Singapore-based medical laboratory, in 2018. The acquisition is part of TPG’s purchase of Healthscope (Australia), an Asian pathology laboratory that operated Quest Laboratories in Singapore and Viet Nam, and Gribbles Pathology in Malaysia.23 Global pharmaceuticals are bringing their R&D and clinical tests and trials to the region. For example, GSK (United Kingdom) conducts many clinical trials of medicines and vaccines for tropical diseases in Thailand. In that host country, it also supports R&D projects for vaccines for influenza, human papillomavirus, and anti-Hepatitis B.24 Takeda (Japan) opened a clinical research centre in Singapore. Other MNEs have also set up R&D facilities in Singapore, such as Philips (Netherlands), which opened a regional oncology centre with a local partner, and Hoya Surgical Optics (United States), which opened a research facility to develop solutions for cataracts.

Many of them have pursued integrated operations from pharmaceuticals to health care solutions, and from technology development to life sciences. Such expansion along the health care value chain is made possible by their large resources, their global networks, and their access to expertise and advanced research and technology. Some global medical device manufacturers, such as GE Healthcare (United States), Siemens Healthcare (Germany) and Philips (Netherlands) have expanded their portfolio in health care in ASEAN into medical technology and medical solutions. There are more M&As in pharmaceuticals than in other health care segments (section 3.3.2). For instance, Abbott Laboratories (United States) has acquired Glomed, a Vietnamese drug manufacturer; Adamed Group (Poland) acquired a stake in Davipharm, Vietnam’s fastest- growing pharmaceutical company, for $50 million; CFR International (Chile) acquired Domesco JSC (Viet Nam), the third-largest listed drug maker in Viet Nam, for $63 million; and Daiwa-SSI Fund (Japan) acquired a 20 per cent stake in CVI Pharma (Viet Nam).26 Fifty largest pharmaceutical MNEs Of the 100 largest pharmaceuticals companies in the world, 79 have a presence in ASEAN.

ASEAN pharmaceutical companies Many ASEAN pharmaceutical companies focus on producing for and serving their respective domestic markets. These local companies have manufacturing facilities to produce their own brands of generic drugs and serve niche markets. Many are contract manufacturers to foreign and local pharmaceuticals companies (table 3.20). Their contract services increase the competitiveness of their countries for FDI in pharmaceuticals. Some ASEAN pharmaceutical companies have established joint-venture partnerships and strategic alliances with major MNEs and other ASEAN pharmaceutical companies, including as contract manufacturers (box 3.4).

Pharmaniaga (Malaysia) operates in Indonesia with manufacturing, distribution and trading functions; Hovid (Malaysia) has subsidiaries in the Philippines and Singapore; and Lloyd Laboratories (Philippines) has established multiple subsidiaries in ASEAN (manufacturing facilities in Indonesia), a subsidiary in Singapore and Thailand, and a representative office in Viet Nam. Sunward Pharmaceuticals (Singapore) has expanded to Malaysia. Some ASEAN pharmaceutical companies internationalize to grow and expand abroad because of limited markets and cost challenges at home. For instance, local companies in Singapore and Malaysia have internationalized to lower costs or diversify geographical operations to overcome such challenges at home. ASEAN pharmaceutical companies also have established strong business linkages with international pharmaceutical MNEs by using those MNEs as contract manufacturers. Pascual Laboratories (Philippines) manufactures 75 per cent of the product requirements in the Philippines and the remaining 25 per cent are imported or contracted out to companies such as Mundi Pharma (United States), Optaderm (Canada) and VistaPharma (United States). Other factors that have motivated ASEAN pharmaceutical companies to internationalize include the need to operate close to customers by following them to markets abroad (e.g. neighbouring ASEAN Member States), as well as investment opportunities and increasing demand for pharmaceutical products in host markets such as in the CLMV countries. Home- grown ASEAN pharmaceutical companies first export their products to overseas markets through the appointment of agents in host countries and later establish distribution and marketing subsidiaries abroad (often with local partners) (e.g. Kalbe Farma (Indonesia), Dexa Medica (Indonesia), United Laboratories (Philippines)) (section 3.6.2). 3.4.4. Health care start-ups and innovators Start-ups play an important role in strengthening the health care ecosystem. This cohort",
    "241": "of health care actors is growing rapidly because of emerging opportunities brought about by digital technologies and medical innovation. Increasing interest by VCs and PEs, including more opportunities to access their funding, have led to the strong environment in the region for start-ups. Health care start-ups offer a wide range of technological and medical solutions, from surgical robotics, artificial intelligence (AI) and tele-health to data analytics and cloud applications (section 3.5). They are involved in providing health solutions to assist patients, improving surgical procedures, distributing medical equipment, developing AI and data analytics applications, and delivering tele-health and telemedicine services (box 3.5). 145 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN Box 3.5. Definitions of tele-health and telemedicine A common feature of tele-health and telemedicine is that they both use information and communication technologies to overcome geographical barriers in providing clinical support with the goal of improving health outcomes. Tele-health Tele-health involves the use of telecommunications and virtual technology to deliver health care outside of traditional health care facilities. For example, it could include virtual home health care, which may involve guidance in certain procedures for patients or elderly people in their homes. Health care workers in remote areas could use tele-health to obtain guidance from professionals elsewhere on the diagnosis, care and referral of patients. Telemedicine Telemedicine is a subset of tele-health. WHO defines telemedicine as “The delivery of health care services, where distance is a critical factor, by all health care professionals using information and communication technologies for the exchange of valid information for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease and injuries, research and evaluation, and for the continuing education of health care providers, all in the interests of advancing the health of individuals and their communities” (WHO 2010, p. 9). The distinguishing feature",
    "242": "of telemedicine is that it is restricted to services delivered by physicians, whereas tele-health is services provided by health professionals in general, which encompasses nurses, pharmacists and others. Source: World Health Organization. They innovate and initially serve their home market. However, some quickly scale up and expand to neighbouring ASEAN Member States to diversify their geographical coverage and to exploite their proprietary advantages through FDI. First-mover advantages and success in fundraising for expansion also play roles in encouraging start-ups to venture abroad quickly. Some start-ups have established strategic partnership with bigger corporations for the delivery of care services, which also facilitated their internationalization. Top 50 most-funded medical technology start-ups The top 50 of these start-ups in ASEAN had raised nearly $1 billion in venture capital funding as of July 2019, with nearly 80 per cent raising their funds since 2017. This underpins the rapid growth in fundraising by health care start-ups in the region. These firms mostly operate in tele- health, medical devices, biotechnology and health solutions segment (figure 3.8). A majority of these top 50 are based in Singapore (39), and they accounted for more than 88 per cent of all funds raised by start-ups in the region (figures 3.9 and 3.10). Singapore’s more developed start-up and medical ecosystems explain the high concentration in that country (AIR 2017, 2018). 146 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Some of these start-ups have not yet internationalized. They serve only domestic markets because of large home markets that have yet to be fully tapped. Halodoc (Indonesia), a telemedicine system, helps patients consult doctors through messaging and calling services in Indonesia. Some start-ups are born global because the type of technology they provide enables them to reach out to global markets. Element (Singapore), a biometric identification software",

They are also in their early stages of development and of the fundraising exercise. Another reason why these firms are yet to open offices in another ASEAN country is the standardized nature of the type of medical technology, which makes it possible to conduct cross-border business across ASEAN without having a physical base in the target country. Such medical technology start-ups use their home markets as a base to expand overseas. MyDoc (Singapore), a digital health care platform, connects patients to providers and health services. It offers such services in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam but does not have",
    "244": "offices in these Member States. Some of the top 50 indicated that their primary reason for raising funding is to internationalize and expand to markets abroad. Homage (Singapore), a tele-health company, has raised financing to expand to new Asian markets. Joi Health (Viet Nam), a tele-health company, raised $5 million from Monk Hill Ventures (Singapore) in 2019 to expand across Southeast Asia. PurelyB (Malaysia), a consumer health portal, has raised funding to expand to Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong (China). Connexions Asia (Singapore) has operations in Indonesia and is planning to expand to Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. mClinica (Philippines), a provider of mobile health technology for pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry, expanded in Southeast Asia after getting funds from Kickstart Ventures (a corporate VC associated with Globe Telecom (Philippines)). Kickstart, together with 500 Startups (United States) and IMJ Investment (Japan), invested in mClinica for its expansion in Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam. Ucare.AI (Singapore), an AI-based disease prediction solution for health care professionals, is planning to expand into other ASEAN Member States. Many of these start-ups have opened operations outside ASEAN, such as in the United States, to tap into the medical ecosystems of other countries (e.g. Biofourmis (Singapore) and Tessa Therapeutics (Singapore)). More than two-fifths of the top 50 have foreign operations outside Figure 3.11.

Note: Some start-ups have established a presence in ASEAN and concurrently outside the region. 15 21 24 In ASEAN Outside ASEAN Have no foreign operations 148 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care ASEAN. The driving force to expand abroad is not market-seeking reasons but research and talent-seeking motives (e.g. a subsidiary of Engine Biosciences (Singapore) in San",
    "245": "Francisco employs mainly scientists). Some start-ups partner with corporate VCs to expand into new digital health areas. Others have established partnerships with large hospital groups and significant organizations in other ASEAN Member States to scale up (box 3.6). Outside the top 50 start-ups are other players engaged in operations and services across ASEAN, such as LumaHealth (Thailand), a health insurance platform that offers insurance plans in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam. CyGen (Malaysia), a cloud-based, patient-centric, cognitive preventive health care platform, has operations in Malaysia and India and plans to expand to other ASEAN Member States. Geob International (Malaysia), which provides smart wearables for diabetic patients, has expanded its operations to Singapore. Box 3.6. Health care start-ups: partnerships with larger corporations Some start-ups have entered into partnerships with major corporations to strengthen their place in the value chain, to scale up or to expand the customer base for the application of their technologies. In 2018, Siloam Hospital Group, Indonesia’s largest health care group, partnered with BookDoc (Malaysia), an online platform for connecting patients and health care professionals. Through the partnership, Siloam gained access to BookDoc’s expanding network of patients across ASEAN. BookDoc, established in 2015, now operates in five Member States. The start-up has also partnered with Malaysian health care providers such as National Heart Center, Sime Darby Healthcare and KPJ Healthcare; in Singapore with NTUC, Singapore Medical Group, Pacific Healthcare Holdings, Asian American Medical Group and Q&M Dental Care; and in Thailand with Bumrungrad Hospital.a In some cases, some start-ups operating in e-commerce or other digital domains invest in health start-ups to form strategic partnerships. For instance, on-demand app Go-Jek (Indonesia) and e-commerce platform Blibli (Indonesia) partner with Halodoc (Indonesia). The strategic partnership involves Go-Jek’s motorcycle delivery in sending out medicine. Go-Jek has its own medicine delivery feature",

Services supporting health care development Other companies also support the development of the health care industry. These companies include those in insurance, IT-BPM services, logistics and specialized hospital cleaning services. 3.4.5.1. Health insurance Health insurance provides coverage to hedge against the risk of significant out-of-pocket health care costs and uncertainty about the need for medical treatment. It plays an important role in supporting the development of the health care industry through providing insurance coverage. There are three main categories of insurance: national health insurance by the public sector, corporate health insurance and private health insurance. Private health insurance involves two main groups of actors: insurance MNEs that offer health insurance in host countries and in ASEAN, and hospital groups in the region that provide health insurance plans to policyholders. The provision of health insurance in ASEAN is dominated by major insurance MNEs, mainly from developed countries, and many have been in the region for decades. For instance, Aetna (United States) and Cigna (United States) have operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. Similarly, AXA (France) has a commercial presence in a number of ASEAN Member States. Insufficient hospital beds and facilities, possible high out-of-pocket costs and customers’ desire to have quick access to health care continue to drive the demand for private health insurance. This has translated into business opportunities for health insurance providers, including insurance MNEs. The strong network, partnership and collaboration between insurance companies and health care service providers (hospitals, medical centres, government) highlights the growing interconnection of",
    "247": "health care players along the value chain. Many telemedicine businesses are linked with health insurance, for example; they settle the bills with the insurance companies without involving patients (e.g. DocDoc (Singapore)). Within the health insurance industry, companies are also increasingly moving towards digital environment through digitalizing records of policyholders, claims and other information for data analysis purposes. There are also links between insurance companies and tele-health. Health care service providers are working closely with insurance companies to develop insurance plan to meet patients’ needs. In expanding their policyholder base, insurance companies are developing partnerships and alliances with various stakeholders including hospitals, government and tele-health companies, as well as policyholders themselves (box 3.7). They are also using digital technology and AI to support their operations through data analytics and in improving the effectiveness of their marketing reach. 150 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Box 3.7. Insurance MNEs with strategic partnership arrangements in ASEAN Allianz (Germany) expanded its network and customer base in the region in 2018 with new part- nerships to reach out to new customers. It partners with BDMS (Thailand), PolicyStreet (Malaysia) (a fast-growing start-up) and Go-Jek (Indonesia) (a rapidly growing mobile platform). As part of its strategy to expand network and customer base in health business, it invested $35 million in Go- Jek in 2018. The investment is an extension of the existing insurance partnership.a Aetna (United States) has an agreement with Swiss Life to offer customers of Swiss Life expatriate health care coverage in Southeast Asia. It has sold health insurance in Singapore since 2012. Cigna (United States), through an arrangement with Parkway Shenton (Singapore) (a large private medical operator), provides customers with access to health care services. The arrangement covers more than 100 health care centres and clinics. CS Global",

ASEAN hospital groups Some ASEAN hospital groups have also developed their own health insurance products and services. The Raffles Medical Group (Singapore) has established Raffles Health Insurance (RHI). One of its products is Raffles Shield, which is integrated with and complements the public health plan (Medishield Life) for Singaporeans. RHI partnered with Bupa International (United Kingdom) to establish World Health Options. Insured by RHI and administered by Bupa, World Health Options is Raffles Medical Group’s modular international health insurance plan for individuals and families. 151 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN BDMS has established a health and life insurance operation within the group. In 2015 and 2016, the group’s health insurance contributed to",
    "249": "more than 22 per cent of patient revenue payouts. It has partnered with the German insurance company, Allianz Ayudhya Assurance in Thailand, to offer health insurance riders to patients. St. Luke’s Medical Center (Philippines) has partnered with Aetna International (United States), Prudential (United Kingdom), Bupa International (United Kingdom) and eight other insurance providers in providing health insurance coverage. 3.4.5.2. Health care-related IT-BPM IT-BPM activities facilitate and support the operations of upstream health companies (e.g. pharmaceuticals and insurers) and providers (e.g. hospitals) by offering IT-BPM services to companies within the same group of MNEs (shared services centres) and to third parties. Outsourcing back-office and IT functions to health IT-BPM companies helps improve the efficiencies and operations of upstream health care actors. There are three types of health IT-BPM companies in ASEAN: (i) MNEs that have established shared service centres, (ii) independent IT-BPM MNEs that provide services to third-party clients, including those based in ASEAN, and (iii) local IT-BPM companies that serve third- party customers. Most health IT-BPM companies (shared service centres and independent IT-BPM companies) in ASEAN are located in the Philippines, because of the country’s cost advantage, language skills and supportive national policy towards the development of the business process outsourcing (BPO) and IT-BPM industry. The health IT-BPM companies in the Philippines are involved in data encoding, transcribing and related services (table 3.21). Table 3.21.

VC and PE investors The role of VCs and PEs is important in supporting the development of medical technology start-ups in ASEAN (section 3.4.4). Many foreign and regional VCs and PEs have invested in health care infrastructure and in start-ups. Most regional VCs, excluding corporate VCs, operate in Singapore. Private equity companies such as Bowsprit Capital and Clermont (both based in Singapore) and Navis Capital (Malaysia) have investments in hospitals in ASEAN. The Clermont Group (Singapore) has investments in hospitals in the Philippines and Viet Nam. In 2013, it acquired an 80 per cent stake in Hoan My Medical Corporation (Viet Nam), which has 14 hospitals and six clinics. It is also a significant shareholder in Medical City, a leading private health care provider in the Philippines, and has invested in medical start-ups in telemedicine such as in Halodoc (Indonesia) and Vie Vie (Viet Nam). Navis Capital (Malaysia) signed an agreement to invest in PT Tawada Healthcare, one of the largest medical device distributors in Indonesia, and has an investment in Hanoi French Hospital. Tawada partners with many international health care equipment manufacturers such as Carestream (United States), Siemens (Germany), Drager, Samsung (Republic of Korea), Medtronic (Ireland), Abbott Vascular (United States), Smith & Nephew (United Kingdom) and Baxter Healthcare (United States) to distribute their products in Indonesia. Quadria Capital (Singapore) has over $1.8 billion in assets under management and investments in 18 companies across the Asia-Pacific region. Its investments in ASEAN include Lablink (a hospital laboratory chain",

Halodoc (Indonesia) has received investments from Go-Jek (Indonesia), NSI Ventures (Singapore), Singtel Innov8 (Singapore) and the Clermont Group (Singapore). CXA Group (Singapore), a predictive and data intelligence platform for better health, wealth and wellness choices, raised $25 million in its latest round of funding from investors that included HSBC (United Kingdom), Singtel Innov8 (Singapore), Telkom Indonesia MDI Ventures (Indonesia) and Muang Thai Fuchsia Ventures. 154 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Japanese VCs are also involved in ASEAN tele-health start-ups. For example, Medical Departures (Thailand) received funding support from CyberAgent Capital (Japan)27 and OPT SEA (the Asia Arm of Japanese digital advertising agency OPT Group; Sumitomo (Japan) subsidiary Sumitomo Corporation Equity Asia (Hong Kong, China) funded Connexions Asia (CSA); and Japanese-based Strive and Shin Ryoku Trust funded Healint (Singapore). A number of VCs from China and Hong Kong (China) have stakes in ASEAN tele-health start-ups. For example, SXE Ventures funded BookDoc (Malaysia), Cyberport Macro Fund funded Connexions Asia (Singapore) and Wuxi Apptec funded Halodoc (Indonesia). VCs from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand mainly support tele-health start-ups from their respective countries. GnB Accelerator (Indonesia) funded TeleCTG (Indonesia) and Pesan Lab (Indonesia), RHL Ventures (Malaysia) and Cradle Health Ventures (Malaysia) funded HealthMetric (Malaysia), and Invent (Thailand) for Meditech Solution and Santora Nakama (Thailand) funded YesMom.",

These start- ups are internally funded by the group. 3.5. DIGITAL REVOLUTION AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION COMPANIES IN ASEAN The application of digital technologies (e.g. robotics, artificial intelligence, data analytics, cloud and 3D printing) in health care is changing the industry and in the delivery of care services to patients in the region. Actors that used and developed such technologies include foreign digital and health care MNEs and start-ups in ASEAN. The use of such technologies in the provision of health care (e.g hospitals and clinics) in ASEAN is expanding because of positive externalities. They include improvements in health care efficiency and medical precision, better diagnostic and analytic capabilities, and better patient care outcomes (e.g. faster patient recovery with minimal incisions). Hospitals and other stakeholders in ASEAN are also using such digital technologies to improve administrative and marketing functions and to better reach out to customers, including in digitizing medical records for data analytics. Major health care providers in the region have used digital technology to advance the quality of care and to provide greater access to care (box 3.8). For example, the Bumrungrad International Hospital (Thailand) has integrated the IBM Watson technology into the hospital’s oncology department to process patient data, access medical literature and provide guidelines to offer personalized treatments to cancer patients. The IBM Watson has a processing power of 80 teraflops and can access 90 servers, with data storage of more than 200 million pages. 155 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the",
    "255": "Health Care Industry in ASEAN The digital technology, equipment and solutions used by health care providers in the region are mainly supplied by MNEs from the United States, European countries and Japan through their sales and distribution subsidiaries based in ASEAN or through their local distributor partners. These companies include GE Healthcare, Intuitive Surgical, Stryker, Varian (all United States); Philips Healthcare (Netherlands); B. Braun, Fresenius, Siemens Healthineers (all Germany); Elekta (Sweden); and Olympus and Sysmex (both Japan) (table 3.23). Not many local companies have the capability and capacity to develop complex medical equipment such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray machines and surgical robotics. Many of these health care MNEs also have established a presence in the region to provide aftercare services, training and education in the use of such technologies and equipment. Some MNEs have also established related R&D centres in Singapore and data centres in a few Member States (e.g. Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore) (AIR 2018). ASEAN start-ups have also contributed to the development of the health care industry through their digital innovation in medical solutions in areas such as tele-health and telemedicine and other medical technologies (section 3.4.4). Box 3.8. Applying digital technologies in health care Hospitals in ASEAN are using or planning to use cloud technologies to improve efficiency. Such technologies are linked to cloud computing suppliers and data centres. Developed-country MNEs are the main actors in this segment (AIR 2018). Cloud technology can help hospitals achieve cost effectiveness, as it uses less electricity since data centres are running off-site and capital costs could be low because of less hardware needed. Cloud resources are scalable and provide flexibility, which facilitate easier management of growth and capacity-planning. It is more secure and could handle significant data storage requirements from off-site places. Robotics technology and telemedicine improve",

In Thailand, the Robodoctor (manufactured by Intouch Health (United States)) is used in a number of hospitals. The technology allows specialist doctors in hub hospitals to assist doctors in remote hospitals in diagnosing and treating patients with complicated conditions, such as stroke. The technology increases the result of more efficient diagnosis and treatment. Similarly, the Bangkok Hospital network also used Robodoctor in three of its hospitals (Bangkok Hospital, Bangkok Hospital Pattaya, and Bangkok Hospital Phuket). Bumrungrad hospital (Thailand) has also employed robotic technology to increase efficiency such as a robot pharmacist. Robots are being tested in Singapore hospitals for porter services. An example is Rowa Vmax, manufactured by CareFushion (Germany). It retrieves medicine from a storage cabinet when a prescription has to be filled, automatically updates stocks and sends an alert when supplies are low. Hospitals in Singapore such as Tan Tock Seng and National University Hospital uses the Rowa Vmax. While many of these medical robotic technologies are developed and supplied to ASEAN hospitals by MNEs from the United States, European countries and Japan, there are ASEAN- based start-ups developing surgical technologies too. They include EndoMaster (Singapore), with its robotic-assisted surgical system for endoscopy that enables surgeons to perform incision-less surgeries (section 3.6.3). Robots have been developed and are used for elderly care and for recovering patients. These robots assist doctors and nurses in monitoring blood pressure and other health information. Robots can also help Alzheimer patients and provide companionship to the elderly in nursing homes.29 Asia Robotics (Thailand) has developed the elderly care Dinsow Robot, which keep tracks of medications, video-phones relatives, exercises with the patient and recognizes the faces and voices of elderly patients (section",

AI solutions, tele-health and telemedicine AI, machine learning and data analytics are increasingly being applied to develop new medical solutions, platforms and digital technology to help patient access to health care. Tele-health and telemedicine have been one of the fastest-growing areas of digital health in ASEAN and an area in which many start-ups have successfully secured VC investments. AI adoption rates differ across ASEAN Member States, with Singapore in the lead.30 For example, one of the biggest health care insurers in Singapore, NTUC Income, deployed IBM Watson to digitally process almost 15,000 monthly claims. Private medical group Parkway Pantai (a subsidiary of IHH Healthcare Group (Malaysia) uses AI to generate hospital bill estimates. Mount Elizabeth, Mount Elizabeth Novena, Gleneagles and Parkway East hospitals use AI and machine learning algorithms from Singapore-based start-up Ucare.AI to generate personalized bill estimates based on parameters such as the patient’s medical condition and medical practices. Many of the top 50 most funded health care start-ups are in tele-health and telemedicine",

It has benefited from exchanges of best practices and benchmarks, discussions of",
    "267": "the latest medical technologies and improvements in the quality of health care service. The group cooperates with the Penang Adventist Hospital in Malaysia through knowledge and information exchange. The group also collaborates with foreign medical technology and equipment suppliers to leverage on packages and acquisition of devices (table 3.27). ASEAN Economic Community A regionally integrated market, through the AEC, can offer opportunities as well as challenges. Although it could facilitate entry of more hospitals, it may not help address the issue of access to affordable quality health care by the general public. With this in mind, the group continues to focus on providing lower-cost and affordable quality health care service, while embracing the greater competition that will be brought about by the AEC.

Medical tourism SFCMC is a PEZA-approved health care service provider for medical tourism. The management of SFCMC is of the view that the international medical tourism industry in the Philippines is not as competitive as in other leading countries in the region because the infrastructure network (airports, roads, traffic) in the capital city needs to be further developed.

Some of its bioactive fractions developed from the country’s rich biodiversity (herbal, animal and marine) are exported to Cambodia, the Philippines, Singapore, Canada and the United States. ASEAN Economic Community An integrated ASEAN would offer investment and business opportunities for health care businesses. However, there are integration challenges that ASEAN governments need to address, with support from the private sector. The concept of one market in the pharmaceutical industry could translate into one stop-off point in any ASEAN country for pharmaceutical approval (i.e. an approval for a pharmaceutical company to produce and market a product in Indonesia would apply in other ASEAN countries as well). The development of ASEAN-owned generic pharmaceutical companies could contribute to developing the backbone of a strong, ASEAN-wide generic drug industry. Dexa welcomes the efforts of the ASEAN governments towards an integrated region and believes in the importance of a public-private sector collaboration to realize such integration. The pharmaceutical market in ASEAN is poised for higher growth, and as such, Dexa is continuing to build on its presence in the region.

The system can remove gastrointestinal cancer tumours without the need for incisions in the body or organ of the patient.56 It enables physicians to perform such minimally invasive surgery with greater precision and in less time. The company’s endoluminal system would reduce operation time for open and keyhole surgeries from two hours to just 45 minutes. Plans EndoMaster plans to take its technology further by building devices that can take advantage of the body’s other natural orifices such as the mouth, nose and ears to treat other ailments. The company’s advanced technological breakthroughs in both the robotic and algorithmic elements mean that the procedure is sufficiently differentiated from other robotic offerings on the medical technology circuit.

Table 3.42 highlights its past and current investments in ASEAN. FDI motivations Quadria Capital believes that the ASEAN health care presents one of the most attractive investment opportunities in the world. The region’s rapidly growing population, emerging middle class, and under-invested health care systems for chronic diseases, provides a compelling motivation for private health care investments. 192 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Quadria invests in companies with substantial growth potential across all segments of health care.

CONCLUSION The ASEAN health care landscape is changing because of rapid growth in demand, increasing private participation, an improving investment environment and the advancement of digital revolution and medical technologies on the delivery of care. The development of the health care industry, however, varies between countries (chapter 4). The growing population, changing demographics and increasing middle class are contributing to the health care demand challenge. With limited resources, the public sector cannot meet this challenge alone. The private sector, including FDI, can play a role by complementing the efforts of the public sector in developing the health care industry and in delivery of affordable services. FDI and foreign participation in health care in ASEAN are rising. Foreign companies are contributing to",
    "307": "the development of the health industry through equity investment, strategic partnership and non-equity forms of participation across the different segments of the health care value chain. Foreign companies and institutions collaborate or establish alliances with ASEAN health care providers (hospitals) in training, education, R&D activities and knowledge exchange. This relationship, through equity and non-equity forms, is important for the development of an efficient health care ecosystem in the region. 193 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN There are various categories of actors in the health care industry. Homegrown ASEAN health care companies (hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and start-ups) have also internationalized to other ASEAN Member States to grow, diversify markets and take advantage of emerging opportunities. Both private hospital groups and PEs are major investors in hospitals in the region. Some major hospital groups have foreign investment stakes in them. Major global pharmaceutical MNEs are present in ASEAN, operating in multiple locations and with multiple business functions. Many global pharmaceuticals and insurance MNEs have long had business ties with countries in the region. They continue to expand operations, driven by investment opportunities, cost advantages and market potential. In general, FDI across the health care value chain (from hospitals, clinics and pharmaceuticals to insurance) is market-seeking. Engaging in a joint venture with local partners is a common feature of MNEs’ participation in the region’s pharmaceuticals segment, especially in marketing and distribution functions. Local knowledge, distribution channels and business networks of local partners are important considerations. Contract manufacturing is another key feature. This segment involves ASEAN and foreign companies as contract manufacturers to local firms and also to other MNEs. The vibrant contract manufacturing sector increases the competitiveness of ASEAN Member States in attracting pharmaceuticals FDI (for both market-seeking and efficiency-seeking motives). The advent of digital",
    "308": "technologies has led to the emergence of new types of actors with business models that are transforming the delivery of health care and access. Medical start- ups in the region such as in tele-health, telemedicine and medical equipment are growing because of increasing attention and investment interest by VCs and PEs. These start-ups are also partnering with larger firms to scale up and to expand market reach across the region – thereby contributing to the development of the health care industry and broader access to health care facilities. Local and foreign health care actors across the value chain can help improve the efficiency and quality of care in ASEAN through the health infrastructure they build and manage, pharmaceuticals manufacturing and distribution (generating import substitution and export promotion effects), the supply of modern medical equipment and devices, alliances in sharing of knowledge and best practices, and provision of health insurance. Although international insurance MNEs are major actors in the insurance segment, ASEAN health care providers such as hospitals are also involved in providing health insurance coverage. ASEAN hospitals and clinics are using modern medical technologies and equipment (e.g. robots for surgery) supplied by foreign health care companies through their agents and distributors based in the region. Some ASEAN companies have developed robotic medical equipment and solutions including telemedicine that have expanded health care activities to more people. Another key feature of the health care industry in the region is the rise in medical tourism. Some Member States have witnessed a rapid growth in medical tourism because of their affordable and better quality medical care environment, which is the result of targeted and coordinated 194 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care national policies and efforts (chapter 4). The rise has translated into opportunities for private hospitals",
    "309": "to invest in and upgrade facilities. The increasing list of JCI accredited hospitals has also helped these countries develop the medical tourism industry. The prospects for private investment and FDI in health care in the region are promising. There is growing interest by ASEAN companies, hospital groups, MNEs, PEs, VCs and other stakeholders to increase investments in health care in the region because of the significant market potentials and opportunities. New types of companies are emerging, especially medical technology start-ups. As they internationalize to other ASEAN Member States, they contribute to the growth in intra-ASEAN investment and a larger pool of ASEAN companies in the health care ecosystem. 195 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN NOTES 1 Based on WHO data. 2 Deloitte, “A prespective of future healthcare landscape in ASEAN and Singapore (https://www2.deloitte.com/). 3 World Economic Forum, “The cost of healthcare is rising in ASEAN.

INTRODUCTION Regional development and cooperation among the ASEAN Member States have contributed to the improvement of the region’s investment environment. MNEs and ASEAN companies operating in the health care industry in the region need to evaluate the changing health care landscape, which is continuously shaped by national development and implementation of regional health-care-related policies. Stakeholders should monitor the health care investment environment as ASEAN continues to integrate through the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint 2025. By 2025, the AEC is expected to become a single market of nearly 700 million people in a $4.7 trillion economy. It will also further strengthen the competitive production base, which is characterized by free flows of goods, services, investment, capital and skilled labour as well as a more strongly connected region. Following from the analyses of chapter 3, this chapter analyses the importance of the regional and national investment environments in relation to FDI in health care. The chapter highlights regional health care cooperation (economic aspects) and the implications of economic agreements for health care investment. It also presents",
    "313": "key aspects of investment policy and health care development in ASEAN Member States, including efforts undertaken to attract foreign investment.

Regional cooperation has evolved from addressing social and public health issues to incorporating economic aspects of health, with implications for investment and the development of the health care industry. 198 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Over the years, ASEAN’s economic integration has resulted in significant agreements, measures and institutional development. Major ASEAN economic agreements have improved the region’s investment environment for health care. They include the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement (ACIA), the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS), the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) as well as other aspects of the development of the AEC. The implementation of these agreements has affected the investment environment in terms of liberalization (e.g. market opening, foreign equity ownership), facilitation and cross-sectoral linkages. Ongoing efforts to harmonize health regulatory issues, including through the MRAs, have implications for investment, business operational strategy and the efficiency of the health care environment. During AEC 2015, health care cooperation was accorded importance as one of the 11 priority sectors identified for accelerated integration. Monitoring and understanding regional commitments and development in health care is imperative for players and other stakeholders to operate efficiently. As Member States open up their health care markets and as regional agreements push for further liberalization as well as harmonization of standards, opportunities for health care FDI in ASEAN will continue to grow. 4.2.1. Development context Health care cooperation in ASEAN started in 1980.",
    "314": "It initially focused on technical cooperation on public health issues with ministerial meetings that took place every three to four years. Stronger regional health care cooperation started in the mid-2000s with more frequent ministerial meetings (at least every two years) to address the threat of infectious diseases (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza) and to mitigate the economic impact of such threats (e.g. disrupted working hours, productivity and tourism). In 2006, the ASEAN health ministers addressed the need to enhance competitiveness in health-related products and services, strengthen capacity for good clinical practice and clinical trials, and promote healthy lifestyles.1 As ASEAN cooperation on social aspects of health care has strengthened over the years, cooperation on economic aspects has also gathered strength. Under AEC 2015, the economic aspect of health care development involved elimination of import tariffs, opening-up of health services trade, and harmonization of standards and technical regulations for health and medical devices. Health care integration has been given specific attention under the AEC Blueprint 2025, which involves sector-strategic action plans and measures. Over the years, ASEAN-wide efforts related to health care have transformed from initial sectoral cooperation mainly on public health issues to include cross-sectoral arrangements with social and economic dimensions. Health care features prominently in major ASEAN economic agreements, attesting to the significance of the industry and of health care development to the region. 199 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN 4.2.2. Health care in major ASEAN economic agreements Several major economic agreements and strategic action plans that form the building blocks of the AEC also affect investment in the health care industry. ASEAN is also implementing facilitation measures that include the ASEAN Agreement on Movement of Natural Persons and MRAs on several professional services, including health care services. The region",
    "315": "has identified and is harmonizing some regulatory issues (e.g. common technical dossiers for registration of pharmaceutical products and regulation of medical devices). Once fully implemented, these measures will increase the efficiency and the competitiveness of the region for private health care activities. Work on harmonization and market opening in health care is ongoing under the AEC and the implementation of sectoral agreements and strategic action plans. Under the AFAS, ASEAN Member States have already relaxed foreign equity ownership restrictions in health care. In most cases, 100 per cent foreign ownership in hospitals is allowed under the AFAS 10th package (AFAS-10) (table 4.1). The implementation of the various economic agreements (e.g. the AFAS, ACIA and ATIGA) has contributed to improving the investment environment for health care in the region (table 4.2). Table 4.1.

MRAs also contribute to improvement to the regulatory environment for health care business and investment in the region (see MRAs at the end of the table). ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) 2009 • Facilitates free f ow of goods in the region through deeper economic linkages among Member States and elimination of trade barriers. • The ATIGA replaces the 1992 Common Effective Preferential Tariff scheme for ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement that saw signif cant elimination of tariffs to 0-5 per cent on most tariff lines for intra-ASEAN trade. • Through the ATIGA, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand have eliminated intra-ASEAN import duties on 99.6 per cent of tariff lines. Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam have reduced import duties to 0 to 5 per cent on 98.9 per cent of tariff lines. • With little intra-ASEAN tariff to reduce, the ATIGA focuses on addressing non-tariff measures to improve the region’s environment for trade",

It also provides a large health care market of 650 million people in a combined $2.4 trillion economy. The market size and movement of goods across ASEAN under the ATIGA help lower costs and help companies reap the advantages of economies of scale to improve business eff ciency. ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement (ACIA) 2009 • A main economic instrument to realize a free and open investment regime. It aims to create a liberal, transparent and competitive investment environment in ASEAN. It replaces the predecessor ASEAN Investment Agreement. • The agreement covers manufacturing activities (including pharmaceutical and medical devices manufacturing).

ASEAN Common Technical Dossier (ACTD) for Pharmaceuticals 2016 • A common technical dossier for submission to ASEAN regulatory authorities for the registration of pharmaceuticals for human use. A common dossier will help expedite registration by pharmaceutical companies of products for distribution in the region. Companies need to prepare only one format for all Member States, thus reducing time and resource costs. It will also facilitate the preparation of electronic document submission. ASEAN Medical Device Directive (AMDD) 2015 A legal and institutional framework to harmonize medical devices regulation in the region. A key objective of the AMDD is to ensure the f ow of safe, effective and good quality medical devices in ASEAN. Harmonization in AMDD includes several elements: • Def nition of medical device • Risk-based classif cation • Standards (for a similar level of quality assurance) • Common submission dossier template • Essential principles of safety performance • Post-marketing alerts system • Registration of product • Licencing of establishment • The directive covers harmonization of medical device regulations and the establishment of common technical documents for use in operating in the ASEAN medical device market. • ASEAN Member States such as Indonesia are transiting licencing procedures to online systems that connect with customs to expedite transactions.",

Evidence of this growth in confidence are the growing production networks, strengthening regional value chains and increasing trade volumes, expanding operations of MNEs, continuously rising FDI including intra-ASEAN investment across industries, and rising favourable investment sentiments about the region (AIR 2017, 2018). AEC 2015 has also influenced many MNEs and indigenous companies to begin operating in ASEAN as a single market.

AEC Blueprint 2025: Consolidated Strategic Action Plan (Health care) A Consolidated Strategic Action Plan (CSAP) was formulated to achieve the goals set out in AEC Blueprint 2025. Table 4.3 presents some of the health-care-related measures of the Blueprint. The CSAP contains indicative timelines for actions to be undertaken by the responsible ASEAN sectoral bodies and facilitates stakeholders’ feedback to the ASEAN economic integration processes. The key strategies and corresponding measures are focused on facilitation actions and promotion of investment opportunities. Facilitation actions include harmonization and standardization of health care products and services. Other measures include creation and promotion of investment opportunities, PPPs, medical tourism and start-ups in health care tech. AFAS: the 10th package of market liberalization and facilitation measures ASEAN is implementing its 10th and final AFAS package, which further liberalizes and facilitates trade and investment in a wider range of services (which include health care). Building on the past achievements and the need to move forward with development, ASEAN concluded the ASEAN Trade in Services Agreement (ATISA) in 2019. Implementation of the ATISA will further strengthen trade in services, reduce barriers and provide for the transition from a positive list to a negative list approach for market liberalization.

HEALTH CARE POLICIES AND DEVELOPMENT IN ASEAN MEMBER STATES Health care services vary widely among ASEAN Member States. A common feature is that the provision of health care services remained a major challenge given limited public budgets, growing populations, demographic changes and the rise in the incidence of non-communicable diseases. Some Member States have underdeveloped and insufficient medical facilities from years of underinvestment. In the face of the lack of better-quality facilities and equipment, patients in Member States such as Indonesia, Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam travel to neighbouring countries for medical services on an out-of-pocket payment basis. All Member States have plans for universal health care coverage. By 2030, citizens in all ASEAN Member States are expected to have access to health care. The progress made towards universal health coverage in 2018 varied significantly by country. Some have already achieved more than 80 per cent coverage (UHC index), while others, such as",
    "325": "the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, currently have low coverage rates.2 Some Member States have emerged as major destinations for regional and global medical tourism (e.g. Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand). They have lengthening lists of hospitals accredited by the Joint Commission International (JCI), which means that they meet a certain level of international standard of care and have a more developed health care ecosystem. In some cases, strong institutional support and targeted policies promoting medical tourism played an important role in the success of these Member States in attracting medical tourists (chapter 3). Some, like Viet Nam, are also receiving an increasing flow of foreign patients from neighbouring countries. Health care spending in the region has been relatively low compared with that of the OECD countries, suggesting room for further expenditure and investment to develop and upgrade the health care industry. The level of private sector participation in the industry varies between countries. In some, participation is as low as about 15 per cent, while in others the private sector accounts for more than 50 per cent of the country’s hospital establishments or hospital beds. Insufficient human resources (doctors, nurses and other qualified health care providers) and medical technology are major challenges for the development of the health care industry in the region. All ASEAN Member States have recognized the important role of the private sector in health care. PPPs are encouraged, to support health care development. Member States are promoting foreign investment in health care, such as in the establishment of hospitals as well as the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. Some health care subsectors are 206 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care closed to foreign investment, such as small hospitals (in some Member States this applies to those with fewer",
    "326": "than 50 beds) and the manufacturing of traditional herbal medicines. Most Member States import proportionately more pharmaceutical products and medical devices than they export. Many are encouraging the development of domestic capacity and industry in areas such as pharmaceutical production for local markets as well as for export. Some Member States are actively promoting private investment in more advanced areas of health care such as biomedical, life sciences and R&D. Many Member States have in recent years further opened up the health care industry to FDI and are allowing completely foreign-owned operations in hospitals and other health care subsectors, such as the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. However, such operations must meet certain requirements, such as thresholds for investment capital. Investment incentives are provided to approved health care projects, which generally include tax holidays and exemptions from import duties for equipment. Health care investment projects located in special economic zones (SEZs) also receive additional investment incentives. The following subsections detail the state of health care services and investment in them in each ASEAN Member State. 4.3.1. Brunei Darussalam Public health care services are either free or heavily subsidized by the Government. The out-of- pocket payment per capita is relatively low. When public hospitals are unable to provide specific services, the Government coordinates and pays for citizens to be treated overseas. Some citizens also seek advanced medical services outside the country, specifically in Singapore and Thailand. The country has one of the highest ratios of hospital beds per 1,000 people in the region (2.7 in 2015). The population has grown from 401,000 in 2010 to 428,960 in 2018, and is expected to reach 478,000 by 2025. It is also ageing, with 4.9 per cent of the population aged 65 or older in 2018. This figure is expected to climb in",
    "327": "future years and will further increase demand for health care services. Role of private sector Although the Government is the main provider of health care, the private sector plays an important role in the country’s health care system, with two of six hospitals in the country privately owned. Some 64 per cent of all health care establishments are run by the private sector (table 4.4). The two private hospitals are Jerudong Park Medical Center and Gleneagles JPMC (a joint venture between the Government and Parkway Group Healthcare, owned by IHH (Malaysia)). Table 4.4. Brunei Darussalam: Public and private health care facilities (Number) Health care facility Public Private Hospitals 4 2 Health centres 14 1 Health clinics 2 33 Source: Brunei Darussalam Ministry of Health: Health Information Booklet 2017 (revised as of January 2019). 207 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN Health plan The Government has established a Master Plan for the Health System and Infrastructure, which sets out 20 years of strategic actions to develop the country’s health care system. It covers seven efforts3: (i) Promote service excellence. (ii) Support health management and a healthy lifestyle. (iii) Ensure sustainability of the health system and maintain universal access. (iv) Enhance policies, regulations and operations to ensure protection and quality of care. (v) Support proactive and transparent governance of health care. (vi) Strengthen mission and capacity and upgrade all government hospitals and health care facilities. (vii) Strengthen the health centre network throughout the country. Brunei Darussalam has high coverage of essential services with relatively low out-of-pocket spending. The WHO Universal Health Coverage (UHC) index of the provision of essential health services without causing financial hardship to citizens stood at more than 80 per cent in 2018.4 Policy encouraging FDI in health care FDI in health care is permitted.",
    "328": "Companies incorporated in Brunei Darussalam are allowed to have 100 per cent foreign ownership. Investment incentives are provided for investment activities in five priority areas: (i) halal, (ii) technology and creative industries, (iii) business services, (iv) tourism and (v) downstream oil and gas activities. Manufacturing activities related to health care (e.g. pharmaceuticals and health supplement products) and provision of health care services are covered under the halal or tourism (medical tourism) priority areas. Brunei Darussalam welcomes FDI in halal-related industries, which include the production of pharmaceuticals and health supplements. A 174-hectare Bio-Innovation Corridor has been established to support the development of such industries. The Government promotes health care manufacturing activities in the following areas: (i) Medical equipment and supplies: • Supply and delivery of medicines for the Department of Pharmaceutical Services • Supply and delivery of medical items for the Central Sterile Services Department • Supply and delivery of laboratory test kits for Clinical Chemistry Laboratory (ii) Medical devices and infrastructure upgrades. As part of the plan to consolidate and realign the government health care services, major upgrades are required for hospitals and health centres across the country. Private investment and participation are encouraged in these areas. 208 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Medical tourism International companies are encouraged to develop tourism-related activities, including medical tourism. 4.3.2. Cambodia The health care industry in Cambodia is underdeveloped and inadequate. There is less than one hospital bed per 1,000 people, a much lower ratio than in neighbouring countries. Some segments of the population travel to neighbouring countries (e.g. Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam) to seek medical treatment. Private health care providers play an important role. In addition to investment in hospitals, there is growing foreign investment interest in the country’s health-care-related manufacturing activities. About 60",
    "329": "per cent of health expenditure during 2008–2016 was through out-of-pocket payments.5 This is one of the highest shares in ASEAN. Another 20 per cent of the expenditure comes from the public sector, with the remaining 20 per cent contributed by development partners. Health spending as a share of GDP ranged between 5 and 7 per cent between 2007 and 2016. It increased from $1 billion in 2012 to $1.2 billion in 2016, driven mostly by increased out-of-pocket expenditures.6 The out-of-pocket payment per capita in Cambodia is high compared with other countries in the region. It rose from $28 in 2010 to $46 in 2016, suggesting a greater use of private facilities. The Government is increasingly spending more on health care, in infrastructure as well as in human resources, and is building health care capacity. It set a target of increasing expenditure from 1.3 per cent to 2 per cent of GDP in 2018. Despite this growing contribution, the financial gap in funding the Third Health Strategic Plan (2016–2020) is estimated at $1.1 billion.7 Foreign investors can play a role in filling the gap and contributing to the development of the health care industry in the country, especially in hospitals and in the pharmaceutical and devices industry. The medical device market is small, and production of medical devices is negligible. The pharmaceuticals market was valued at $255 million in 2015, as compared with $215 million in 2011.8 The Ministry of Health is the largest purchaser of medical supplies. Role of private sector The private sector is an important provider of health care services. Although the public sector is the prominent provider of preventive services and inpatient admissions, the private sector dominates in curative care. It also accounts for the significant share of total health care spending. In 2016, the private sector",
    "330": "accounted for 62 per cent of hospitals in the country. With increasing FDI in hospitals in recent years, the number of foreign-owned or managed hospitals has also increased. As of the end of 2015, there were 8,488 licensed private facilities (excluding pharmacies), ranging from nursing care rooms, to pregnancy care rooms, and from consultation cabinets to clinics, polyclinics and hospitals.9 209 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN Health plan The health policy goals of Cambodia are to improve health outcomes and increase financial risk protection across the population (Third Health Strategic Plan 2016–2020). These overarching goals are supported by a set of health development goals (improving reproductive health; reducing maternal, newborn and child mortality and malnutrition among women and young children; reducing morbidity and mortality caused by communicable diseases; reducing morbidity and mortality caused by non-communicable diseases and other public health problems; and making the health system more accountable and responsive to the population health needs). Various programmes (e.g. Health Equity Fund, Community-based health Insurance and Social health Insurance) provide coverage for part of the population, especially the poor and vulnerable. Cambodia aims to have universal health coverage. Under the National Social Policy Protection Framework (2016–2025), the Government aims to provide health care to all citizens by 2025. In 2018, the country’s UHC index stood at 55 per cent. Policy encouraging FDI in health care In supporting the development of health care, the Government encourages FDI in the industry. The country has a liberal foreign investment regime. The 1994 Law on Investment, the 2003 Amended Law on Investment and related sub-decrees govern FDI. Foreign equity ownership of 100 per cent is allowed in health care, including in hospital activities. Investment incentives in health care Investment incentives are provided to health care projects that meet certain conditions",
    "331": "and requirements. Sub-decree No. 111 sets out the investment conditions that are not eligible for investment incentives. There are no special incentives for investment in the health care industry. General incentives include corporate tax holidays of up to eight years, a 20 per cent corporate tax rate after the incentive period ends, duty-free import of capital goods and no restrictions on capital repatriation. Projects in SEZs enjoy additional incentives such as zero rate value added tax and import duty exemption for raw materials, machinery and equipment.10 Foreign investment in health care Investors from Member States such as Singapore and Thailand as well as from Japan have been investing in the health care industry in Cambodia since the 1990s. Raffles Medical Phnom Penh, owned by Raffles Medical Group (Singapore), has been in operation since 1992. Other foreign-owned health care facilities include MW Medical Cambodia, operated by the MW Clinic chain (Singapore), as well as the Royal Angkor International Hospital and the Royal Phnom Penh Hospital – both managed and operated by Bangkok Dusit Medical Services Group (Thailand), and the Sunrise Japan Hospital, in which three Japanese companies (JGC Corporation, Innovation Network Corporation and Kitahara Medical Strategies International) have invested through a joint venture. Kitahara Medical Strategies International also manages 210 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care and operates the Kitahara Neurosurgical Institute and the Kitahara Japan Clinic.

Demand for international-standard health care facilities, better-quality medicine and medical devices is on the rise. There is also potential for health insurance investment, given the high out-of-pocket payments and the demand for a better quality of care. 4.3.3. Indonesia Public health expenditure has been increasing and the population is ageing (table 4.5). Public health expenditure per capita rose from $63 in 2010 to $162 in 2016. Out-of-pocket health care expenditure has declined from 57 per cent of total health expenditure in 2010 to 37 per cent in 2016, suggesting an increase in the provision of public health facilities to the population. The health care system in the country continued to face challenges in 2018. Although public expenditure has increased, health care services remain inadequate and unevenly distributed. The lack of a skilled workforce also limits the development of the health care industry. To reach more of the population, including in remote areas, future reforms are likely, especially in the use of digital technology or new medical technology (e.g. telemedicine or e-health). Other reforms could cover more innovative ways of addressing the challenge of the distribution of the health workforce, including contracting in by local governments; and dealing with the implications of removal of restrictions on free movement of the health workforce under the ASEAN commitment.11 Table 4.5.

Private hospitals accounted for 47 per cent of hospital beds and 64 per cent of hospitals in 2017 (table 4.6). However, the private sector actually contributes about 41 per cent of hospital beds in the country, if public health centres with some patient bed facilities are taken into account. Health plan Indonesia introduced the goal of a universal health coverage system in 2014, and the Government aims to cover the entire population by 2019.12 However, only about 76 per cent of the population was covered under the national health insurance in 2018. With limitations on the public sector supply side, the goal of universal coverage provides opportunities for further PPPs. Policy encouraging FDI in health care In general, Indonesia encourages FDI in health care, but there are some subsectors that are still closed. Foreign investment is not allowed in medical clinics, delivery clinics, specialized clinics and dental clinics.13 However, foreign investment is allowed in large hospitals (those with at least 200 beds), including specialty or subspecialty hospitals. Foreign investment in small- to medium-scale health facilities is prohibited. Foreign investors may build a new hospital or operate an existing hospital through a joint venture with a local investor. In some health care subsectors (e.g. manufacturing of pharmaceuticals), the Government has further liberalized investment, and 100 per cent foreign equity ownership is allowed, particularly in activities that produce raw materials for medicines and clinical laboratories.14 Foreign equity ownership in clinics and certain-sized hospitals is restricted (e.g. investment is not allowed in hospitals with capital or numbers of hospital beds below certain thresholds). The Government continues to regularly update the lists of sectors that are open and",

Of the more than 210 pharmaceuticals manufacturers in Indonesia, 70 per cent are domestic.16 About 75 per cent of Indonesia’s medication needs are provided by these companies. Half of the medications available in the market (including those requiring a prescription) are sold through private practices, general stores, street vendors and supermarkets. The remaining 25 per cent of Indonesia’s medication needs are provided by foreign pharmaceuticals MNEs. These companies have invested over $1 billion in Indonesia’s pharmaceuticals market in recent years.

Although most essential medications are produced locally, some 90 per cent of active ingredients are imported.18 Indonesia imported over $800 million worth of pharmaceuticals products in 2016, compared with $710 million in 2014. In 2016, the United States was the largest exporter of pharmaceuticals to Indonesia ($114 million), followed by Germany ($95 million), France ($71 million), Switzerland ($61 million) and the United Kingdom ($58 million).19 Medical devices Owing to the absence of local capabilities, Indonesia imports almost all medical devices used in the country.20. A majority of the device registrations in the country (90 per cent in 2013) are made by foreign manufacturers. 21 The medical device market was worth $1 billion as of 2018. Information technology and healthtech Electronic medical records (EMRs) are starting to be adopted in Indonesian hospitals, but the transition is moving slowly. There is currently no legal regulation that governs the use of electronic health records nor is there a national guideline for it. Hospitals are, however, free to adopt or develop their own EMR.22 With increasing interest from venture capital firms and the influence of digital technology, medtech and digital start-ups in the country have been growing rapidly in recent years, 213 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN contributing to the development of the country’s health",

Indonesian ride-hailing unicorn Go-Jek has branched into health care in partnership with Halodoc (a tele- health platform provider). 4.3.4. Lao People’s Democratic Republic The health care system in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is underdeveloped and inadequate, and faces challenges in meeting growing demand. It has transitioned from a centralized system providing free health services to a system that increasingly relies on out-of- pocket payments by patients.23 The public sector is the main provider of health care services but has a limited budget. Provision of health services thus continues to rely on out-of-pocket spending and on external financing. Between 2011 and 2016, the county’s public health expenditure more than doubled, from $183 million to $386 million. As a share of total health expenditure, public spending increased from 21 per cent in 2010 to more than 32 per cent in 2016. However, total health expenditure as a share of GDP and government expenditure on health as a share of total government expenditure remain low compared with other countries. In 2016, total government health expenditures accounted for 2.4 per cent of GDP, and all expenditures on health, including external funding, accounted for 5.9 per cent. Nonetheless, health expenditure is",
    "337": "expected to rise as the economy grows. Access to health care services is also unevenly distributed, with most facilities concentrated in major cities. Because of the lack of facilities and the low quality of care, some citizens travel to neighbouring countries (e.g. Thailand and Viet Nam) for medical treatment, which they finance with out-of-pocket payments.24 The country depends on international aid in the form of vaccines, training for medical professionals and staff, and strengthening of maternal and child health. In recent years, foreign aid (e.g. from China and Japan) has contributed to building hospitals and clinics. Private sector participation has been limited, but recent years have witnessed increasing interest by foreign investors in privately owned and managed hospitals. Role of private sector Both domestic and foreign private investment in the health care industry is still low. The private sector accounts for about 20 per cent of the country’s health care establishments, which 214 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care include hospitals, clinics and health care centres. At the end of 2015, there were 13 private hospitals and 1,053 private clinics.25 Some investors have come from neighbouring countries such as China, Thailand and Viet Nam. Bidiphar, a leading pharmaceutical company in Viet Nam, established a presence with a local partner as long ago as 1994. More recently, in 2018, the Bangkok Chain Hospital Group (Thailand) established a private hospital worth $40 million with a local firm.26 The Ministry of Health has received investment proposals to open private hospitals in the country from investors in China, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam, as well as other countries.

The current health insurance programme covers only 20 per cent.27 Policy encouraging FDI in health care The Government encourages PPPs and foreign investment in health care. Despite the small market, there are opportunities for foreign investors, especially in the provision of high-quality health care facilities, affordable medicine and medical devices. However, challenges in the country’s efforts to develop the health care industry include the shortage of skilled professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses) and of pharmaceutical capacities. The amended Law on Investment Promotion 2016 is the governing law of investment in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. It stipulates that health care is one of nine business sectors that are entitled to investment incentives, subject to meeting certain requirements (e.g. minimum capital investment). In particular, it includes the development of modern hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical equipment factories, and traditional medicine production and treatment. Investment incentives Investment incentives listed in the Law on Investment Promotion include exemption from profit tax, exemption from import duties and value added taxes, and land-use-related incentives. Investment in approved health care projects enjoys a longer period of exemption from profit tax. Restrictions on foreign investment in health care In general, foreign investors can invest in any sector or business except in cases the Government deems to be detrimental to national security, national health or national traditions, or to have a negative impact on the national environment. Foreign investment is allowed in some private hospital services (modern hospitals with more than 100 beds, in big cities only). Under the AFAS, 100 per cent foreign equity ownership is allowed for hospital services and health insurance. The retail industry was also fully liberalized in 2015, which means foreign investors can engage in the retail pharmaceutical business. 215 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN",

The Government promotes health care development that involves collaboration between relevant ministries, agencies and the private sector. Key features of the industry are the co-existence of the public and private health systems and PPPs. The Government also incentivizes health care providers to provide better-quality and affordable health care. The country’s health expenditure increased from $293 per capita in 2010 to $361 per capita in 2016. In local currency terms, health care expenditure rose by 23 per cent between 2014 and 2017 (table 4.7). The private sector accounted for more than 50 per cent of the expenditure. Role of private sector The private sector complements government efforts to provide good-quality health care in the country. The private sector accounted for 24 per cent of the country’s hospital beds in 2017. Under the 11th Malaysia Plan, the Government is strengthening the role of the private sector in service delivery, expanding capacity to increase accessibility (e.g. the private sector will be encouraged to collaborate and set up more health care facilities that cater to the needs of low- and middle-income households), and intensifying collaboration with the private sector to increase health awareness.

The Ministry of Health plans to implement an EMR system in stages at hospitals and clinics throughout the country within the next three years. With EMRs, the process of sharing and transferring patients’ information will be easier. Policy encouraging foreign investment in health care Malaysia promotes FDI in health care. In general, FDI is encouraged through a joint venture between Malaysian and foreign investors. Under the World Trade Organization commitment, foreign equity ownership in a private hospital cannot exceed 30 per cent and the facility must have a minimum of 100 beds.

Incentives are also provided for health care activities established in SEZs. For instance, health care activities operating in the Iskandar Development Region enjoy the following benefits: (i) Exemption from compliance with the withholding tax provisions on payment of royalty and services fees to non-residents for a period of 10 years from commencement of operations (ii) Unrestricted employment of foreign knowledge workers (iii) Flexibilities under the foreign exchange administration rules (e.g. make and receive payments in foreign currency with residents, borrow any amount of foreign currency from licensed onshore and non-residents).

Challenges There are challenges in attracting FDI in health care, especially in recruiting talent to support emerging health care industries or products and in developing raw materials for pharmaceuticals production. For instance, strict policy and regulations on hiring foreign doctors, which limit opportunities for investment from other countries. Strong competition from neighbouring countries in health care services is posing a challenge in medical tourism. New expertise and skills for complex products need to be developed. The medical devices and pharmaceuticals industries require (i) skilled personnel in specific areas such as biomedical, mechatronic, mechanical, advanced materials and nanotechnology devices and (ii) industrial pharmacists and production and process engineers. Raw materials availability could be improved. This challenge relates to the following: (i) Necessary imports of certain main raw materials such as APIs, titanium and medical-grade resin, as no local manufacturers exist (ii) Import substitution, as the Government encourages local companies to scale up and diversify operations to supply to industry players 220 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services:",

The Government has put in place a dedicated policy supporting the development of medical tourism and a system involving coordinated institutional support, led by the Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council. Under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan 2016-2020, medical tourism is recognized as a key initiative and as a growth sector under the National Key Economic Area plan. 4.3.6. Myanmar Health care services in Myanmar are underdeveloped and insufficient following years of underinvestment.

Pharmaceutical sales in 2017 amounted to $456 million, and that figure is expected to grow by 7 per cent through 2022. Most medical devices are imported because of the lack of local manufacturing capacity. The health insurance subsector is also small, as the health insurance scheme was only introduced in 2015.

The new Myanmar Investment Law 2016, which replaces the Myanmar Citizen Investment Law 2013 and the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law 2012, liberalized the industry for investment. It also streamlined the process for investment applications. Foreign investment into private hospitals, clinics, diagnostic services, production of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and private medical and health-related education institutions, is allowed subject to approval requirements. Under the AFAS, foreign ownership in investment in hospitals is allowed up to 70 per cent. Importation and resale of medical equipment is permitted to foreign investors in joint venture with a Myanmar partner. Some activities are restricted, such as health centres for the elderly and domestic laboratory research. Investment incentives Certain subsectors in health care, such as hospital services, medical laboratories and clinics are promoted through investment incentives. Investors in these subsectors are eligible for tax exemptions for a period of three, five or seven years, depending on the location of the investment. Additional incentives are provided for projects in SEZs. In response to the severe shortage of medical devices, regulations on import and resale of medical equipment provide a most-favoured-nation duty rate of 1.5 per cent and an exemption from commercial tax. The import licence fee is exempted on 67 kinds of medicines and pharmaceutical raw materials used in the manufacture of medicines.

In addition, many generic pharmaceuticals brands from India, China, Thailand and Viet Nam are present; they account for a significant share of the generic drugs market in the country. 4.3.7. Philippines Demand for health care in the Philippines is increasing because of population growth, urbanization and the rising middle class. The increase in the incidence of non-communicable diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease, cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) and the Government’s efforts to implement a universal health care plan have also contributed to the increase. Health care expenditure remained stable in 2016 (the latest available data) at 4.4 per cent of GDP (compared with 4.3 per cent in 2010), with out-of-pocket payments accounting for 54 per cent of expenditures. Health expenditure per capita grew from $92 in 2010 to $129",
    "350": "in 2016, an increase of 40 per cent. Investment in health care has been low. There is a lack of both health care infrastructure (hospitals) and human resources (doctors), which is putting a strain on the health care delivery system. Private hospital services are dominated by domestic hospital groups. The ratio of hospital beds to population has remained low compared with that of other Member States. There was on average one hospital bed per 1,000 people in 2016. Role of private sector The private sector plays an important role in the development of the health care delivery system in the Philippines. Private hospitals, pharmaceutical producers, and health care IT companies are expanding in the country.33 According to the Department of Health, the private sector comprises 50 per cent of the country’s health system. The hospital network is a hybrid public-private system.34 As of 2018, there were 1,071 licensed private hospitals and 721 public hospitals. On the basis of these numbers, the private sector accounted for 60 per cent of hospital services in 2018 and 53 per cent of all beds in 2016. 223 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN FDI in hospitals is small. However, recent years have witnessed increasing attention by foreign investors to the country’s health care industry. The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation has a 14 per cent stake in Metro Pacific Hospital Holdings (MPHH), and Clermont Group (Singapore) owns part of The Medical City in Manila. Metro Pacific operates 14 hospitals with a total of 3,300 beds across the country. MPHH established a 50-50 joint venture with Sanitas (Spain)35 in 2016. In 2017, MPHH established a joint venture with Marubeni Corporation (Japan) and LSI Medience Corporation36 (Japan), a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (Japan). Health plan In February 2019, the",
    "351": "Philippine President signed into law a universal health care bill (Republic Act No. 11223) that automatically enrols all citizens in the National Health Insurance Programme and prescribes complementary reforms in the health system.37 This coverage provides citizens access to health services without causing financial hardship to them. At the end of 2018, more than 98 per cent38 of the population was covered, with 100 per cent to be covered by 2020. The law also expands the coverage of the Philippine Health Insurance System (PhilHealth) to include free medical consultations and laboratory tests. It designated PhilHealth as the national purchaser of medicines, health goods and services for individuals. Strategic engagement of the private sector and improvement of the delivery of health services were also emphasized.39 According to the law, PhilHealth members are classified into two groups: contributory (premium contributors from payroll) and non-contributory (fully subsidized from tax collections). The funding of the previous universal health coverage programme was accomplished through subsidies and contributions from employers and employees.40 The country is promoting e-health to reach more people and to make more use of digital technology in health care. It has developed an e-Health Strategic Framework and Plan (2014 to 2020), which aims to use information and communication technologies in the health care industry to support the delivery of more efficient health services. This is in line with providing universal health coverage to all Filipinos. Policy encouraging FDI in health care The Government is promoting FDI in health care, including in health ecozones. The Foreign Investments Act of 1991 (Republic Act No. 7042) liberalized the entry of foreign investment into the country. Up to 100 per cent foreign equity ownership in health care is allowed unless restricted by the Constitution or other special laws or listed in the Foreign Investment Negative List (table",
    "352": "4.10). Ecozones The Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) is promoting foreign investments in health and wellness and medical tourism hubs as special ecozones, particularly if they are located in areas identified by PEZA for development. As of December 2018, only three medical centres 224 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care have been approved by the Philippine Government as PEZA-registered medical tourism zones. Two of which are highlighted in table 4.11. FDI in the manufacturing of medical devices and pharmaceuticals located in ecozones (under the jurisdiction of PEZA) is allowed 100 per cent foreign equity ownership provided that the manufacturer exports 100 per cent of production. Most of the foreign health-care-related manufacturers that have located in Philippine ecozones or SEZs are Japanese (table 4.12). Table 4.10.

An example",

Under this agreement, private investors provided a haemodialysis machine and other laboratory equipment to the centre. The investors pay the necessary staff, rental and other costs, and share 15 per cent of the revenues with the Centre. This approach was also adopted by the Southern Philippines Medical Centre, a tertiary referral hospital in Davao City. Its management implemented a PPP under which private partners publicly bid to consign medical equipment such as dialysis machines, computed and digital radiography machines, and haematology, chemistry and immune-assay analysers.41 Another example is GE Heathcare’s partnership with the local government of Banna, in Ilocos Norte.

    "355": "care infrastructure. There is an undersupply of hospital infrastructure in the country. (ii) Diagnostics. The level of infrastructure development varies across the country, opening possibilities for regional diagnostic centres that operate hub-and-spoke models for community outreach (e.g. collect test samples and send them back to a central hub). (iii) Telemedicine and remote health: Companies specialized in telemedicine and remote health care monitoring, including Internet-of-Things health care solutions that can improve access to care, can address challenges posed by the terrain and the needs of remote areas, where the population is underserved. (iv) Health care and medical technologies. The country is heavily reliant on imports of medical devices and equipment. Generic pharmaceutical products are evolving into a huge market due to both the demand for low-cost medicine and the strong government support. Production of raw materials for medicines is now 100 per cent open to foreign ownership.43 Foreign investment in health care Foreign pharmaceutical companies have been in the Philippines for more than three decades. They include MNEs such as Abbott (United States) (1938), Johnson and Johnson (United States) (1956), GlaxoSmithKline (United Kingdom) (1963) and Bayer (Germany) (1962) (chapter 3). In line with the Government’s focus on development of generic drugs, foreign companies such as Getz Pharma (Pakistan), Novartis (Switzerland) and Orient Europharma (Taiwan Province of China) have been expanding in the country. Because of the lack of a local industry, the Philippines imports medical devices and equipment from major MNEs. Some of these MNEs have also established a presence in the country to supply medical equipment to public and private hospitals. They include GE (United States), Siemens Healthcare (Germany), Medtronic (Ireland), Terumo (Japan), 3M (United States), Fresenius (Germany), B. Braun (Germany), Elekta (Sweden) and Royal Philips Healthcare (Netherlands) (chapter 3). In the hospital/medical centre diagnostics industry, local and foreign health",
    "356": "care players are forming joint ventures and/or working partnerships and cooperation for more synergistic alliances. The foreign health care player usually brings in the technology and expertise, while the domestic partner takes on the day-to-day management of the facility. St. Frances Cabrini Medical Center (SFCMC) partners with Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital (Japan) in providing lectures and training at SFCMC facilities. Nursing staff from the SFCMC have been deployed to Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital as registered nurses with licenses to practise in Japan. MPHH established a 50-50 joint venture with Sanitas (Spain) in 2016 to build a chain of primary care clinics across the country that will offer affordable services to patients. It operates four primary care clinics in Metro Manila. 227 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN Medical tourism The Philippines is also a destination for medical tourism, although the number of medical tourists to the country is low compared with those in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. The Philippines was ranked the 19th most popular destination in the 2016 Medical Tourism Index.44 Approximately 80,000 to 250,000 foreign visitors come to the Philippines each year for medical tourism. They are mainly from the Pacific Islands (Guam, Palau, Marshall Islands and Micronesia) or are Filipinos who are based abroad.45 A combination of factors have helped the country attract medical tourists. They include the country’s five JCI-accredited hospitals, skilled physicians, English-speaking nurses and affordable care. 4.3.8. Singapore Demand for health care in Singapore is increasing, driven in part by the rapidly ageing population and the prevalence of chronic diseases. The Government is increasing its expenditure on health care by investing in providing access, improving affordability and delivering better-quality care services to all citizens. The public sector accounted for 54 per cent of the country’s health expenditures in 2016, up",
    "357": "from 42.7 per cent in 2010. Total health expenditure increased from 3.2 per cent of GDP in 2010 to 4.5 per cent in 2016, and per capita health expenditure rose by 64 per cent, from $1,502 in 2010 to $2,462 in 2016. Role of private sector The private sector complements the public efforts in the provision of health care services and in developing the health care industry. It accounted for 89 per cent of all health care establishments in the country in 2018 and has been playing an important role in the development of the country’s medical tourism segment (table 4.13). In terms of hospital facilities alone, the private sector accounted for 29 per cent. In 2016, the Minister for Health stated that the private sector accounted for nearly 20 per cent of acute bed capacity and an even larger share of specialist outpatient care. Private general practitioners constitute 80 per cent of the primary care physician workforce and serve 80 per cent of primary care visits. Health plan Singapore is implementing its Beyond Healthcare 2020 plan: “from hospital to community”, “from quality to value” and “from healthcare to health”.

In developing a competitive health care industry, the Government also gives attention to attracting FDI in biomedical, life sciences, R&D and the development of medical technologies. Singapore offers global health care companies a competitive health care ecosystem. Local and foreign investors are subject to the same basic laws. The Government screens investment proposals to determine eligibility for various incentive regimes. Qualified investors are offered investment incentives such as low-income tax, a research incentive scheme, intellectual property development incentives and training grants. The Government grants a Pioneer Certificate Incentive and a Development and Expansion Incentive, which both aim to encourage companies to expand their capabilities and conduct new or expanded economic activities in Singapore. Companies that carry out global or regional headquarters activities of managing, coordinating and controlling business activities for a group of companies may also apply for the Pioneer Certificate or Development and Expansion Incentive for the headquarters activities. 229 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN Foreign investment in medical insurance is allowed, subject to the rules and regulations of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Dedicated life sciences hubs In facilitating health care FDI and MNE operations, the Government has also established dedicated parks and hubs to support life sciences and R&D activities. These infrastructure facilities include Medtech Hub, Biopolis and Tuas Biomedical Park. The Biopolis and the Tuas Biomedical Park are dedicated to supporting the biomedical R&D cluster, including medical technologies. The Tuas Biomedical Park primarily focuses on manufacturing activities, while the Biopolis aims to attract R&D activities. The R&D complex at the Biopolis is also located near research institutes and universities. More than 30 medical technology companies and seven of the world’s top 10 biopharma- ceuticals companies have a manufacturing presence in the country (table 4.16). Local start-ups such as HealthSTATS and Veredus Laboratories also operate in these hubs.48 Medical tourism Singapore is one of the top medical tourism destinations in the world because of the large number of JCI-accredited hospitals in the country and its efficient health care industry. The country has 21 hospitals and medical facilities that are JCI accredited;49 a quarter of all JCI- accredited facilities in Asia are in Singapore.50 The 2016–2017 Medical Tourism Index ranked Singapore fourth, after Canada, the United Kingdom and Israel, with an overall score of 73.6.51 230 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care In 2018, the Bloomberg health care efficiency scorers ranked Singapore second,",

It plays a key role in developing and nurturing referral networks in countries where there is a demand for the medical services that Singapore offers. International Patient Service Centres have been established specifically for medical tourists and expatriate patients. These centres are attached to hospitals to provide information and assistance for international patients. The centres provide hospital pricing to patients and coordinate appointments with health care specialists.53 4.3.9. Thailand Thailand’s health care industry is expanding because of the growing population, rising medical tourism, universal health coverage efforts, investments by foreign companies in manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and devices, and the Government’s efforts to develop the country into a significant medical hub. Thailand’s universal health coverage programme started in 2002. It is financed by three sources of public health insurance (i.e. civil servant medical benefit scheme, social health insurance and a basic universal health coverage arrangement), which today covers almost all of the citizens. The public sector is the main provider of health care services, complemented by services provided by an active private sector. The national expenditure on health care has been increasing, from $172 per capita or 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2010 to $222 or 3.7 per cent of GDP in 2016. Out-of-pocket expenses have remained relatively stable at $25 per capita in 2010 and $27 in 2016, suggesting an increasing use of public facilities. Thailand’s health care industry has faced some challenges. They include the limited supply of skilled professionals and the rapidly ageing population.

By 2045, Thailand’s elderly population is expected to exceed that of other regions such as Europe and the United States. Role of private sector The private sector plays an important role in the development of the country’s health care industry, contributing some 30 per cent of the country’s health resources or facilities.54 This share is much higher in urban areas such as Bangkok, where the private sector accounted for a 60 per cent share. The private sector accounted for 20 per cent of hospital beds in 2015. Many private Thai hospitals participate in providing health care services to medical tourists, contributing to the development of the medical tourism industry. The private sector also participates in supporting the Government’s universal health care coverage. Health plan Thailand has a national plan for the development of the country’s health care. The National Strategic Plan for Public Health (2017–2036) provides the national strategies and guidelines.

Novartis (Switzerland) provides innovative products that treat illness. There are investment opportunities in medical devices and the pharmaceutical industry because of strong growth in demand for devices and pharmaceuticals (including for export). Medical devices The value of medical devices imported into Thailand grew from $557 million in 2011 to $962 million in 2018 (figure 4.1). Over the same period, the value of exports of medical devices increased from $554 million to $843 million. This trend reflects the growing size of the domestic market and the country’s importance as an export base. Pharmaceuticals Thailand’s spending on pharmaceuticals is growing rapidly, doubling between 2010 and 2018 as a percentage of GDP (figure 4.2). This is primarily due to the increasing demand for pharmaceuticals from the ageing population. Other contributing factors include the country’s universal health coverage and the continued growth of medical tourism. The pharmaceuticals market now accounts for almost 20 per cent of all domestic health expenditures, with the majority distributed through Thailand’s public and private hospital system. Table 4.18.

In 2018, the country imported $2.9 billion pharmaceuticals, 16 per cent from China and 12 per cent from the United State and Germany (11 per cent) (Krungsri Research 2018). Its export value stood at $884 million, mainly to the neighbouring countries. Another key area for investment is in medical robotics. The Thailand Center of Excellence for Life Sciences has established a Center for Advanced Medical Robotics. It is focused on international",
    "369": "and regional investors and users, with the aim of broadening Thailand’s research base through advanced medical robotics projects. Some success stories include homegrown companies such as the Dinsow elderly care robot developed by CT Asia Robotics, the Fhasai robot-assisted therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders by Mahidol University; and Sensible Tab arm rehabilitation robot by the Center and TMGI. Medical tourism Medical tourism is a key feature of the Thai health care industry. Thailand is a major medical tourism destination. It has 64 hospitals accredited by the JCI – the highest number in ASEAN 236 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care and the fourth highest in the world.57 The provision of affordable and quality care including other health care facilities (e.g. wellness and spa) has contributed to the rise in the number of medical tourists (figure 4.3). The increasing rise in medical tourism has provided the impetus for a range of technological advances, innovations and clinical studies. Such developments have led to the rise of supporting industries such as pharmaceuticals, laboratory testing and clinical R&D. The Government supports the development of the medical tourism industry and plans to further develop Thailand into a significant international medical hub over the period 2017-2026, in four major areas (wellness, medical services, academic medical centres and health products). The Government has introduced various related measures, which include the following:58 (i) Extending the permitted period of stay for visitors travelling to Thailand for medical treatment from China and the CLMV nations (Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam) to 90 days from 30 days and allowing up to four family members to accompany travellers bound for Thai hospitals (ii) Extending long-stay visas from 1 to 10 years for individuals from 14 specified nations (iii) Assembling",

Viet Nam High economic growth and increasing personal incomes, a growing population and rapid urbanization along with an ageing society have led to a rising demand for health care service in Viet Nam. The country’s population is growing rapidly. In 2010, it was 87 million and by 2018 it had grown by 10 per cent to 96 million. The society is also ageing, with the population older than age 60 projected to triple to 32.4 million (28.3 per cent of the population) by 2050.59 237 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN Viet Nam’s health care expenditure rose from 5 per cent of GDP in the 1990s to about 7.5 per cent in 2018 ($17 billion), one of the highest rates in ASEAN. It is expected to grow to $23 billion in 2021, representing a compound annual growth rate of 12.5 per cent between 2017 and 2021.60 The country imports most of the medications it needs, but local capacities are improving. The pharmaceuticals market had an estimated revenue of $5.9 billion in 2018. The country’s drug imports in 2018 increased by 8.8 per cent year-on-year to $3.7 billion. In 2018, about 300,000 medical tourists travelled to Viet Nam, while 40,000 Vietnamese spent approximately $2 billion abroad for health care service.61 Despite the significant public expenditure on health care, the Government faces challenges to meet",
    "371": "the rapid growth in demand. Outdated and overcrowded hospitals, obsolete medical equipment and shortages of qualified medical staff are among them. The health care system has undergone decentralization and privatization in recent years. However, public facilities continue to dominate the health care system. In 2016, there were 1,346 hospitals, which included 1,161 public hospitals, accounting for 86 per cent of the total, and 185 private ones. More than 90 per cent of hospital beds are provided by the public system. The Government aims to increase the share of private hospital beds to 20 per cent by 2020, through PPPs. Role of private sector To meet demand, the Government is promoting PPPs. In 2014, the Government announced plans to deregulate the health care industry and open for foreign investment. For example, the Government encourages the privatization of public hospitals and allows foreign investors to have 100 per cent ownership of Vietnamese hospitals with no restrictions on the number of practising foreign doctors. Local private investors including FLC Group, T&T Group and Hoan My Medical Corporation are active. FLC Group, a resort conglomerate, invested $160 million in an international hospital in the northern province of Thai Binh. The T&T Group acquired a 51.5 per cent stake in Hanoi Transport Hospital – the first privatization of a public company or hospital. Health plan The Government has made development of health care one of its strategic objectives. In Viet Nam’s Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020), the Government listed specific objectives for health care development. By 2020, the country’s health care system is to have 9 to 10 doctors and more than 26.5 patient beds per 10,000 people. Insurance coverage is to be above 80 per cent of the population. To achieve these goals, the Government plans to focus on construction and upgrading of hospitals,",
    "372": "professional education and training, and development of the medicine and health equipment subsectors. In addition, the 2014 national strategy on the development of Viet Nam’s pharmaceuticals industry aims to increase the share of locally produced pharmaceuticals to 80 per cent of market value – strengthening local productive capacities and reducing reliance on imports. 238 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Health insurance became compulsory for all Vietnamese citizens in 2015. In 2018, 87 per cent of the population was covered, up from 68 per cent in 2013. The Government is aiming for universal coverage by 2030. The health insurance premium averages about 4.5 per cent of the reference wage, but the Government substantially subsidizes premiums to the poorest people, students, children under age 6 and beneficiaries of social assistance programmes. The Social Health Insurance Fund accounted for 22 per cent of health expenditure in 2016; however, voluntary health insurance accounted for only 1 per cent of health expenditure.62 Policy encouraging FDI in health care The Investment Law (2014) lists health R&D activities, development of infrastructure facilities and pharmaceuticals production as eligible for investment incentives. Health care service is among the 11 services industries open to foreign investment in Viet Nam’s WTO Commitments. Except for distribution of pharmaceutical products and medications, foreign investors can invest in health care establishments, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and medical education and training units. Foreign investment up to 100 per cent equity ownership is allowed in each of these subsectors with certain conditions on the capital requirement. For example, the capital investment for a hospital is $20 million, whereas a polyclinic requires an investment of $2 million and a specialized clinic $200,000. Home care, nursing and emergency evacuation services are subject to approval on a case-by-case basis.63 Government policy on the",
    "373": "relaxation of the foreign investment limit of the overall 49 per cent cap on foreign ownership in Vietnamese public listed companies in 2015 has also encouraged foreign investors in health care. For example, Abbott Laboratories (United States) now holds a 52 per cent majority share of Domesco Medical Import Export, a leading pharmaceutical company listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange. Japanese Taisho Group spent about $48 million to lift its ownership in DHG Pharma, also a listed company and a top medication distributor in Viet Nam, to 32 per cent in 2018. The Finance Ministry is planning to remove restrictions on foreign ownership of State-owned and listed companies by the end of 2019, which is expected to open up more business and investment opportunities in health care.64 The Government has also issued other laws and implementation decrees to cut procedures and create more favourable conditions for investment in health care. For instance, the 2016 Law on Pharmacy waives requirements for clinical trials of new drugs except vaccines, provided that they have sufficient clinical data on safety and efficiency and are circulated in at least one country anywhere in the world.65 Investment incentives Investment incentives, in the form of tax incentives, tax holidays, exemption from import duties and exemption from or reduction of land rental, land-use levy or land use tax are provided for health care activities such as medical examination and treatment; production of medications and medication materials, major and essential drugs, preventive and curative drugs for social 239 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN diseases, vaccines, medical bioproducts, herbal medicines and oriental medicines, scientific research and biotechnology for producing new drugs.66 Tax incentives and tax holidays are also available to other health care activities. Investment in health care establishments, if qualified as performing",
    "374": "socialized activities and subject to meeting certain requirements, can be eligible for a preferential corporate income tax rate of 10 per cent during the entire operation period instead of the standard rate of 20 per cent. In addition, depending on their location, such health care establishments can also enjoy tax holidays (four years of tax exemption and a subsequent five or nine years of 50 per cent tax reduction).67 Foreign investment in health care Foreign investors have been active in the health care industry in recent years. In 2018 alone, major deals in health care establishments include the acquisition by Sun Medical Center (Republic of Korea) of Nha Khoa My, an international network of dental clinics that has been operating in Viet Nam for 15 years. In anticipation of the Vietnam-Europe Free Trade Agreement, Adamed Group, Poland’s second largest pharmaceutical group, acquired a 70 per cent stake in Davipharm for $50 million. Mergers and acquisitions have been used by foreign investors for immediate access to the local market. Aside from health care establishments, other foreign companies such as Mega Lifesciences (Thailand), DKSH and Zuellig Pharma (both Switzerland) are active in wholesale pharmaceutical activities. Foreign investment in health care is expected to increase because of market opening. The Government has set ambitious targets for the development of the health care industry to meet the growing demand and has also taken measures to encourage investment. It is promoting PPPs in national-scale hospital upgrade and construction projects, which opens up opportunities for private investment. 4.4. CHALLENGES Despite efforts to improve the regional investment environment and strengthen health care cooperation, moving forward requires addressing larger challenges. One area is in harmonization of health care standards and mutual recognition, involving countries at different stages of development. Health care regulatory systems in ASEAN differ. This creates",
    "375": "challenges for health care players, who need to comply with multiple regulatory systems to operate in the region. Progress is being made through the AMDD and the MRAs, but in most ASEAN Member States implementation is far from ideal. Table 4.19 highlights the status of Member States with respect to each of the six AMDD regulatory issues and their disparities. Although the AMDD aims to standardize requirements, local guidelines are still in place and must be followed. This has contributed to some differences in the documentary requirements across the region, and approval of a certain medical device by one Member State does not ensure its approval by other Member States.68 240 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Table 4.19.

There is more to be done to harmonize regulatory standards to support health care development in the region. Other technical issues (e.g. on medication, data protection and data security) need to be considered if harmonization is to transform ASEAN into a competitive medical hub. However, it is important to recognize that the commitment of Member States to the various MRAs and agreements on harmonization of regulatory issues are notable efforts to improve the business environment and to realize the AEC (health care) objectives. A lack of skills, technological capacity and human resources (doctors and other health care workers) continues to weigh on the development of the health care industry across the region. In some Member States, this limitation poses more serious challenges than in others. The emergence of new and more complex health care activities or products (biomedical, advanced medical technology) requires new talents and personnel with the right skill sets. The lack of raw materials that can be sourced locally also poses a challenge to developing a strong local pharmaceuticals industry. Meeting the rapidly growing demand for health care in the region remains a major challenge",
    "378": "because of limited government budgets. Some Member States face challenges in attracting FDI in health care despite recent efforts in opening up to foreign investment. In some cases, a limited market and less developed ecosystem have made it a challenge to attract FDI. There are administrative challenges (in some Member States) in terms of transparency, clarity and streamlining of investment procedures and uncertainties in the implementation of laws and regulations on health care. Providing additional guidance and more clarity on new laws on foreign investments would help alleviate such concerns. The participation of more small and medium-sized enterprises in health care is needed. Such entities face barriers to entry more often than larger ones; examples of such barriers include regulatory challenges and limited access to finance and support for innovation. In regard to attracting private investment in medical technology, the region faces the challenge of a lack of experienced talent, focused capital and a nascent supporting industry. Although cooperation exists, competition in the region in medical tourism is growing. 4.5. POLICY OPTIONS AND WAYS FORWARD To address some of the challenges, the following policy options on investment facilitation, balancing regulation over innovation, coherence of policies in attracting FDI and developing a region-wide medical tourism hub could be considered (chapter 3). Investment facilitation Most Member States have liberal policies for investment in health care. Some are examining measures to support further opening up of the industry. Member States are actively promoting 243 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN and encouraging FDI in health care infrastructure (e.g. hospitals). And in most cases, they allow 100 per cent foreign equity ownership, including in health insurance. Streamlining of investment and administrative measures and procedures can further improve the investment environment. PPPs Given the limited public resources to meet the increasing",
    "379": "demand for health care, a strengthened PPP model could offer a way forward. Member States are already supporting PPPs. However, deeper engagement with various private sector stakeholders from hospital groups to private equity investors could be considered. Smart PPPs and establishing a mechanism for regular public and private sector consultation at the regional level could help spearhead greater private sector participation in the development of the industry, including in digital health. One such mechanism could be an “ASEAN health care council” involving private sector stakeholders to promote the development of an efficient and competitive health care environment. Regulatory issues Some regulatory issues also require attention. They include the following: Overregulation versus promoting innovation There is a need to regulate segments of the health care industry to protect patients and to direct development towards national and regional objectives. However, there is also a need to strike a balance between regulating and promoting innovation. Overregulating could stifle innovation, which is needed to advance the industry and improve efficiency in the delivery of care services. For instance, promoting digital health and ensuring data privacy. Regulations that stop the free flow of data could severely restrict the use of such data, which could stifle investments and development of the health care industry (e.g. tele-health and data analytics). Region-wide regulatory framework Some regulatory issues (aside from those covered under the existing ASEAN MRAs and AMDD) could be harmonized to facilitate cross-border investment in health care, where appropriate. Data protection As the industry moves towards greater digitalization, with EMRs in a digital data environment, there is a need to consider the issues of data ownership, data residency, and data protection and security in order to protect patients. A strong national and region-wide regulatory framework on these issues could be considered. Developing medical tourism Medical tourism is",
    "380": "on the rise in some ASEAN Member States because of their more efficient health care environments. Although medical tourism is important, it should not be the primary 244 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care reason for investment in hospitals. The development of the health care industry should serve local patients. In addition to the local patient segment, medical tourism can make the market lucrative for private investors. Private investment in hospitals that targets only medical tourism does not offer a sustainable business model, as medical tourism revenues can fluctuate and be affected by global events such as recession or financial crises. Where promoting medical tourism is an important item on the economic agenda, it should be built on the basis of efficiency and through the development of a strong ecosystem, and it should involve an interplay of the various stakeholders (e.g. private hospitals, government institutions, health care enablers, transportation and logistics services, the hospitality industry and tourism boards). Recognizing the potential of the region for further growth in medical tourism and the positive externality effects of such tourism (e.g. returns on investment, arrest of “brain drains” of doctors, financing of better equipment and training), an ASEAN medical tourism hub could be considered.69 The aim would be for Member States to cooperate to promote and develop ASEAN as a world medical tourism hub, drawing on the strengths, skill sets and capabilities of the Member States. Such regional cooperation to develop comprehensive health care solutions could bring complementary benefits and synergies to participating countries, including in supporting the objectives of the AEC. Transportability of health insurance Building on insurance to support health care development across the region is worth considering, where viable. At the moment, health insurance is not transportable across borders. Making health insurance transportable",
    "381": "could facilitate health care development in the region. Health insurance providers should be involved in the “ASEAN health care council”. Digitalization and medical technologies In regard to improving the capacity of countries to develop medical technology, Member States could work on developing an environment that is conducive for venture capital firms and start- ups to establish operations in the region. In promoting digital or e-health, the coherence of measures or agreements need to take into account existing agreements such as the ASEAN Agreement on Electronic Commerce, signed in 2018. Incentivizing SMEs There is a need to incentivize and motivate small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups to get involved in health care development, strengthening the ecosystem. Data limitation and data coverage Better data are needed to monitor the development of private investment in the health care industry. The provision of such data can help policymakers examine the significance of investment in health care across different value chain segments and can be of use in the design of policies to attract investment (e.g. in digital health and medical technologies). A task force 245 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN could be established to identify and examine approaches in which better data and information could be extracted from existing reporting systems. Such health care data could be reported regularly to the ASEAN health ministers and economic ministers for use in policy development. 4.6. CONCLUSION The demand for health care in ASEAN is rising. Population growth, changing demographics, universal health care programmes and the rise in non-communicable diseases are pushing up demand for health care services. The public sector alone cannot meet the health care challenge. The private sector can play a role in complementing public efforts and supporting the development of a competitive health care industry. In most Member",
    "382": "States, the private sector has been playing an important role. In some Member States, private hospitals and governments have worked closely to develop medical tourism markets. With the growth in demand, the private sector could contribute through PPP activities and invest in health infrastructure, manufacturing of pharmaceutical and medical devices, and funding of health care start-ups. The investment environment in the region is improving. Key drivers are regional and national development. The former relates to regional cooperation and implementation of agreements relating to health care, including market opening and harmonization of standards and regulatory issues. The latter covers efforts to improve the investment environment, liberalize, commit to realizing universal health coverage and provide an efficient health care system, as well as to strengthen the PPP environment. ASEAN Member States have further opened up the health care market for FDI, where 100 per cent foreign equity ownership under the AFAS is allowed, and they are spending more on developing their health care systems. Investors and companies would do well to evaluate and understand the implications of the changing regional investment landscape, which offers opportunities across the health care spectrum. The region continues to offer investment opportunities, as ASEAN moves towards realizing the objectives of a single market, a competitive production base and a more deeply connected region by 2025. The significance of regional development and an integrated market of nearly 700 million people with a combined GDP of more than $4.7 trillion by 2025 cannot be underestimated. In moving forward to develop a competitive health care environment, existing challenges at the regional and national levels need to be addressed. Some policy options could be considered. They could include investment facilitation to attract FDI in health care, a strengthened PPP model, engagement of insurance companies and transportability of cross-border health insurance, harmonization",
    "383": "of regulatory issues, a balanced consideration between overregulation and promotion of health innovation to increase efficiency, and closer region-wide cooperation on medical tourism to tap the synergy, cost and complementary advantages of Member States. ASEAN Member States need to give stronger attention to digital and medical technology to increase efficiency and to provide a better quality of care. Attracting MNEs, local companies and start-ups in this emerging area of health care delivery is important. 246 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 – FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care NOTES 1 ASEAN Secretariat, “Declaration of the 8th ASEAN health ministers meeting”, 21 June 2006, Yangon (https:// www.asean.org). 2 “Universal health coverage (UHC) means that all people and communities can use the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services they need, of sufficient quality to be effective, while also ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user to financial hardship.” (Source: WHO, https:// www.who.int/health_financing/universal_coverage_definition/en/.)
