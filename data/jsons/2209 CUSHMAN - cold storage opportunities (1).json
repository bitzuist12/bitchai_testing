Much of this food is fresh and needs to be transported, processed, stored and distributed in a cold or frozen state and this has led to a continually burgeoning cold chain industry in China, including growth in the number of quality alternative cold storage logistics warehouse property assets in the country. According to the Cold Chain Logistics Committee (CFLP) and the Intelligence Research Group, the cold chain industry sector in China has enjoyed double digit growth. In 2020, the market size reached RMB415 billion, a year-on-year growth of 22.38%. Considering the future growth momentum, China’s cold chain logistics market is expected to further increase to about RMB897 billion by 2025 (Figure 24). The underlying factors which are having an influence on the growth of the cold chain industry sector in China are many, but some of the more important what-to-watch industry elements which we consider in this report include: ο Greater consumer spending power; ο A further emphasis on food safety; ο Continued importance placed on food security; ο More value being added to goods during the time between when they enter and exit the cold chain system, and; ο Even though playing a small role in cold chain services demand, an increasing need to transport, store and distribute medicines.

Consumer spending power On a household basis, we have seen disposable income in China continue to rise. As disposable income has risen, so individual citizens have spent more on better quality food and food with a variety of taste. In the first half year of 2022, the per capita disposable income of households in China was RMB18,463, an increase of 4.7% since a year ago (Figure 25). From the standpoint of urban and rural areas, the per capita household disposable income of urban residents was RMB25,003, a rise of 3.6%. The per capita household disposable income of rural residents was RMB9,787, a rise of 5.8%.

To ensure food remains frozen and/or fresh, the cold chain industry will resort to relying on the use of the latest technology available, such as: ο Big Data; ο The Internet of Things (IoT); ο Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning; ο Autonomous vehicles; ο Smart cold chain shelving, and; ο Cold chain robots. Big Data: Data is key. It is the lifeblood of the cold chain system that when generated, analysed, processed and effected in the best manner, will",

Therefore predicting the consumer demand for any particular product is possible for them. The visibility of the complete supply chain becomes transparent for the managers, and they can track every shipment. The warehouse managers can avoid overstocking by being aware of how much stock is needed to meet the consumer demand. Companies can decide the final price of products after going through different pricing models. 1 2 3 4 Six Alternative Property Assets What to Watch in China 45 The IoT: The IoT encompasses software and connected devices that recurrently gather, process and convey related data, and in this case enterprise cold chain data. In the industry, this data can be utilised to track goods, optimise routes, avert product counterfeiting, check processes and situations, uncover bottlenecks, produce system reports and more (Figure 28). Figure 28: IoT – Value add to cold chain Source: Ambimat Electronics, Cushman & Wakefield Research AI and machine learning: AI and machine learning can be employed to digest and analyse at speed, huge amounts of data.

On the other hand, China also has many mountains, with mountainous areas taking up two-thirds of its total land area. The country has also experienced much urbanisation and is subject to intermittent natural disasters, such as typhoons. Thus, agricultural production and food security in the region are continually prioritised. The cold chain industry",
    "6": "can offer a number of solutions to food security. Two include: the storage of agricultural produce during peak production periods and made ready for distribution during lean periods, and the mitigation of food loss. Food loss is an important issue. Globally, the European Food Information Council (EUFIC) estimates that one third of all food produced for human consumption is either lost or wasted (Figure 33). Figure 33: Food loss vs. food waste Source: onethird, Cushman & Wakefield Research 1 On the Farm 2 Packaged, Processed, Stored 3 Distributed and Held 4 Sold to the Consumer 5 At the Home of the Consumer FOOD LOSS FOOD WASTE Six Alternative Property Assets What to Watch in China 49 What’s more, there are environmental costs. By some estimates, up to 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to food loss and waste. According to the United Nations Environment Programme around 50% of food losses happen during the initial stages of the supply chain owing to absence of appropriate refrigeration and cold chain tailbacks. Additionally, often if food production exceeds local cold chain capacity at any given time, food is lost. Once food is harvested, it starts to decay. The decay process and speed of decay are influenced by temperature and humidity. Even minor variations in temperature affect the levels of nutrition and the shelf life of food. Picked bananas, for example, are best preserved in conditions where the temperature falls between 13 to 14 degrees centigrade. Apples on the other hand do well when the storage temperature is between 5 and 7.5 degrees centigrade. Therefore, crucial to food safety are cold chain refrigerated vehicles, cold storage rooms, and ripening chambers. Appropriate freezing, chilling or cooling is indispensable for upholding food safety and quality, and the temperature control must be very precise",
    "7": "to prevent faster-than-normal-speed decay or chilling damage. Two modern temperature- related food preservation techniques which can be employed by cold chain service providers, which can go some way to improving food preservation, and at the same time, mitigating food loss, are: ο High pressure processing (HPP) and high- temperature short-time heating (HTST), and; ο Blast freezing. HPP and HTST: Retort packaging, which is usually applied to juices, milk and meat products, can allow for cost-effective sterilisation done in a short time with minimal damage to the product. The product is then palletised and transferred to a cold storage logistics warehouse space for distribution at a later date. Blast freezing: Blast freezing, like retort packaging, extends the shelf life of a product. This procedure involves deep freezing a food product in a blast cell utilising time and mechanical means of low- temperature refrigeration in combination with amplified air velocity. HPP and HTST: Blast freezing: 50 Part 3 Alternative Property Assets Added value A key development in the cold chain industry at present is a move towards value-added services and two examples of these services are: ο Food processing and portion packaging, and; ο Custom pallet building (Figure 34). Figure 34: Simplified cold chain added value Source: Consultancy.eu, Cushman & Wakefield Research Food processing and portion packaging: Custom pallet building: In terms of cold chain cold storage warehouse facilities located near agricultural areas in China, often food produce arrives at the facility in bulk – whether it is grain, vegetables, fruit, dairy products or meat. To add value to this produce, they can be initially processed and then repackaged into smaller containers. For example, some fruit could be cleaned, peeled, sliced, mixed (with other fruit in some cases) and portion packaged in customised packs ready to be distributed to an individual retailer",
    "8": "or supermarket chains at a higher price. This is an additional value-added service cold chain cold storage warehouse facilities operating in the initial stages of the cold chain could offer to save their onward distribution clients time and money. Usually, full pallets of the same food product arrive at warehouses which store products at the initial stages in the cold chain. Rather than forwarding on the produce in the same homogenous bulk format, initial stage warehouse operators can reorganise and customise the pallets to send on with a mix of products that an onward client prefers. The onward client would then be in a position to distribute the pallets directly to their own outlets, be they shops, restaurants, supermarkets, etc. Production of Raw Material Pre- processing Storage Logistical Hub Storage Logistical Hub Storage Distribution Centre Distribution Centre Distribution Centre Logistical Hub Storage Post- processing Storage Post- processing Storage Processing Retail/ Food Service Harvesting Bulk Storage Before Processing Processing Into Finished Products Consumption Palletised Storage of Finished Products Six Alternative Property Assets What to Watch in China 51 Medicines The amount and number of medicines requiring cold chain handling in China has been increasing recently given: ο The push to further improve public healthcare; ο People’s greater awareness of the importance of healthcare; ο People’s capability and willingness to spend more on healthcare, and; ο The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. In response, the cold chain sector in China has had to learn, adapt and invest in specialised processing techniques, transportation and warehouse spaces and facilities to accommodate burgeoning demand. Given the specialised nature of handling medicine products within the cold chain, cold chain operators in China have to follow a number of exacting guidelines, including: ο Packing (if part of the service) and shipping consistent with suggested procedures, and; ο",
    "9": "Storing medicine products within the recommended temperature range during warehouse storage and transportation. As to the last point, storage and temperature, certain medicines need to be stored and kept within a precise temperature range. These medicines are many and include vaccines, biologics, oncology treatments and some types of insulin. Storage temperature ranges vary. Some medicines need to be stored at temperatures that range between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. For others, they need to be stored in a deep-frozen state – say below minus 10 degrees Celsius. In the case of some COVID-19 vaccines, they need to be stored at temperatures below minus 80 degrees Celsius (Figure 35). Figure 35: Cold chain and ultra-cold chain Source: Healthcare Distribution Alliance, Cushman & Wakefield Research Looking to the future, even though the handling of medicine products plays a small part in cold chain service demand when compared to other products like food, we do expect the service demand in China from medicine products will continue to increase as healthcare is further prioritised across the country. Cold Chain Most cold chain products require storage and transportation at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, while frozen products need to be kept below minus 10 degrees Celsius. Ultra-cold Chain Some of the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates are classified as “ultra-cold chain” and need to be held at temperatures below minus 80 degrees Celsius. 52 Part 3 Alternative Property Assets Apart from the industry drivers, there are a number of underlying trends influencing the cold storage logistics warehouse market in China and three major developments are: Property trends Sustainability In order to reduce the amount of energy used by, and carbon emissions from, cold storage logistics warehouses in China, it will be important to take the next step and go carbon neutral. Looking at whole building lifecycle",
    "10": "carbon, the amount of energy and water used during a cold storage logistics warehouse’s lifespan need to be considered. When ruminating on this, many aspects about a building project have to be assessed, including: ο The proposed use of the facility; ο The proposed design of the facility; ο The proposed building systems, plant and machinery used in the facility; ο The extraction of the building materials; ο The processing and manufacturing of the building materials; ο The transportation of the new building materials; ο The construction of the facility; ο The operation, management and maintenance of the facility; ο The re-use/disassembly of the facility (if known); ο The transportation of the old building materials; ο The recycling of the old building materials, and; ο The landsite where the rest of the old building materials will be deposited. Before building, operating and re-using/ dismantling a cold storage logistics warehouse, it will be important to execute on the right whole-building lifecycle approach and to do this, the following elements will also need to be taken into consideration: ο Carbon offsetting; ο Carbon avoidance; ο Embodied carbon, and; ο Operational carbon. Continuing on, one big move towards the creation of zero carbon cold storage logistics warehouses is the move towards the usage of renewable energy. There are a number of sources of renewable energy, but the main ones include: ο Solar power; ο Wind power; ο Hydropower; ο Geothermal power; ο Tidal power, and; ο Biomass power. Much of the attention has also been brought about by a further push by authorities and by investment capital for ο Sustainability; ο Technology, and; ο Advances in warehouse design. Six Alternative Property Assets What to Watch in China 53 development that is environmental, social and governance (ESG) principals driven. Given the ESG development momentum",
    "11": "of late, this driver is increasingly going to become a key influencer in the development and operation decision making of and for cold storage logistics warehouse investors, developers and landlords in China. In addition, more and more real estate developers and real estate fund companies have joined the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB). Some companies operating in China have been participating in the assessment for many years. Green building in China is still continually developing and growing and alongside this development and growth, GRESB will be used more in the country for measuring the sustainability performance of real estate companies and real estate funds, including those that are actively involved in the country’s cold storage logistics warehouse market because: ο It incorporates a rounded methodology; ο It has a clear assessment goal; ο It is an international like-for-like standard that can be used in different jurisdictions across the globe, and; ο It is a standard that is continually evolving. What’s more, when considering optimal carbon neutrality solutions for cold storage logistics warehouse facilities, collective and early involvement of all professionals within the design team is essential. Lastly, one cold storage logistics warehouse project in China which currently incorporates a number of sustainable features is the former Swire Cold Chain Logistics Facility in Shanghai (now owned by Vanke Logistics), which among other features, includes a rainwater recycling system, LED lighting and a geo-thermal heat exchange system (Figure 36 and Case study 3 in the Appendix).

Shanghai cold storage warehouse facility opened. 1816 1982 2011 2018 2004 2014 Technology In addition to the emission reductions earned by preventing food losses, energy efficiency can bring further gains. Cold storage is a very energy-intensive process. 60-70% of the electricity used in cold storage facilities goes towards refrigeration. This means while expanding the cold chain, we must utilise the most energy efficient technologies available, as well as low global warming potential refrigerants to keep the climate impact as low as possible and technology will be key for delivering these solutions. When considering cold storage logistics warehouses and the cost incurred in running these types of facilities, the amount of energy consumption is significant and one of the biggest total occupancy cost drags. This is changing for smart cold storage warehouses, however, with the onset of the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is shepherding in a new period where linked devices stream real-time information and data, via IEEE 802.15.4 wireless mesh technology, cloud and an app, from a smart cold storage logistics warehouse property to a property owner or manager, anytime and anywhere (Figure 37). Figure 37: The IoT – Streaming information and data via linked devices Cloud Owner/Manager Site Source: Cushman & Wakefield Research What’s more, once a decision is made, by using the same linked system and building control technology, owners and property managers can issue turn up, turn down, and on or off control signals remotely to plant and machinery embedded in a smart cold storage logistics warehouse property, in a timely manner. In turn, as efficient plant and machinery control is properly used by smart cold storage logistics warehouse owners and property managers, energy consumption is reduced, and costs are lowered. Areas",
    "13": "where energy consumption and costs can be lowered using a wireless building control system include: ο Air conditioning and fan control – The wireless building control system 54 Part 3 Alternative Property Assets Figure 38: The IoT – Linking devices, conveying control instructions Source: Cushman & Wakefield Research can facilitate advanced schedule and occupancy control for air conditioning and fans. A whole smart cold storage logistics warehouse does not necessarily need cooling or heating at all times. The wireless building control system (combined with motion sensors) can allow the cooling or heating of a specific area to be only activated when occupied. Moreover, exhaust fans and thermal destratification fans can also be remotely turned on or off based on use demand; ο Energy demand – Owners and property managers can use the wireless building control system to automate demand response, so that non-priority plant and machinery can be turned down or off during periods of high energy demand; ο Lighting – The wireless building control system (again, combined with motion sensors) can also lead to smart lighting, which combines with tuning, daylight harvesting and scheduling to provide demand-based lighting optimised for each area of the smart cold storage logistics warehouse. In some cases, this has led to 90% savings in energy consumption costs, and; ο Plug loading – It has been estimated that around 25% of total electricity consumed by offices is down to plug loads. With this in mind, smart cold storage logistics warehouses also have numerous plugs in sockets which can be turned off when not in use. This can be done remotely and in a timely manner via a wireless building control system (Figure 38).

By encapsulating and analysing this data using the latest IoT facilities management software, smart cold storage logistics warehouse operators and lessees alike can be furnished with an improved understanding of the operational effectiveness of their space, including its energy consumption performance. By using the right smart IoT building energy management software in particular, smart cold storage logistics warehouse operators and lessees can now also spot operating variances within energy- consuming equipment, such as HVAC units, and systematise corrective action (Figure 39). Additionally, this smart IoT software can offer integrated tools that examine and compare potential efficiency measures to augment the financial and environmental returns from energy reduction investments (Figure 40).

    "16": "into account in order to design and build a facility that can be best optimised when it is operationalised. Two fundamental factors include: ο The proposed automation system, and; ο The height of the facility. The automation system: Before design commences, it’s best to firstly understand the automation system to be installed in the cold storage logistics warehouse so that the designer can fully leverage the potential of the system to realise greater operational efficiency. Cold storage automation systems include a number of features, including stacker cranes, robotic pallet shuttles and carton handling to name but three (Figure 43). Automation systems also necessitate some specific modifications to operate dependably in low-temperature conditions and these modifications, including, remote visibility into the system to reduce technician time in the deep-freeze environment, cold- resistant lubrication, quick disconnect couplings, and other features that enable technicians working on the system to get in and out rapidly, will have to also be designed in. Design Source: EYDA, Cushman & Wakefield Research Facility height: Conventional cold storage logistics warehouses with 40-foot ceiling heights are not conducive to efficient refrigeration because the area of the roof attracts heat from solar energy, adding to the load on the refrigeration system.

That entails building taller cold storage logistics warehouses, which are supported by automation systems that permit vertical storage, such as those mentioned above (Figure 44). Raising the building",
    "17": "height can allow the cold storage logistics warehouse to achieve Figure 44: Cold storage warehouse heights, aisle widths and stacking systems Source: S&P, Cushman & Wakefield Research a footprint that is more or less one-third that of a traditional cold storage logistics warehouse facility, thus generating substantial operational expense savings over the facility’s lifetime. Given the industry drivers outlined above, the cold chain industry in China is set to grow and this growth will heavily influence the growth and business performance of the alternative cold storage logistics warehouse property asset market in the region. In the coming years, we expect to see more quality cold storage logistics warehouse supply. This supply is expected to cater to the needs of domestic market storage and distribution derived from the importation of fresh goods and products. We also expect more quality cold storage logistics warehouse development space to cater to the need to store more perishable medicines.
