Growing demand in Long An province Located in Long An – Strategic location in Mekong delta  Close to customers: Long An is the agricultural hub for Mekong Delta region and the Southern key economic region  Close to export ports: 48km to major export ports in Saigon port in HCMC and 95km to Cai Mep port - major ports for exportation from the South.  Accessibility for transportation: close to Trung Luong Highway and National Road 1 (3km) - major transportation routes connecting Southern provinces.  The cold storage has the same shareholders as the irradiation business. The irradiation business is one of two in Vietnam accepted by the USDA. Certain export markets like the US and Australia require irradiation of food products as a",
    "3": "condition for import. The irradiation business started operation in October 2018 and has a solid customer base.  The cold storage is situated adjacent to the irradiation facility. Many irradiation customers also need cold storage services before or after irradiation. The two entities complement each other providing a comprehensive solution for export customers. The current owner of cold storage is committed to continue marketing the two services to its customers. Synergy between cold storage and irradiation services  High quality construction.  High quality equipment from EU and Japan. Newly built high quality facility Reason to sell  By constructing the cold storage facility in close proximity to the irradiation business, the intention was to create synergy between the two businesses and subsequently sell the facility once it was fully operational, allowing the owner to focus on growing the irradiation business.

The same type of products only need frozen storage before being exported to other markets not having a requirement for irradiation as a condition for import for example the EU.  The irradiation and frozen cold storage services therefore complements each other and offering both services to the same customer creates advantages for its customers for example in transport savings and convenience and easy possibility for cold storage after irradiation and before exportation.
