    "1": "Independent Market Research Singapore by Jones Lang LaSalle SINGAPORE MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW Singapore’s Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) contracted by 5.4% year- on-year (“y-o-y”) in 2020, recording its worst economic recession since independence. The manufacturing sector, which saw output expanding by 7.3% y-o-y, was the only sector that reported growth in 2020, reversing 2019’s 1.5% y-o-y contraction. In contrast, construction output plunged by 35.9% y-o-y, after rising 1.6% y-o-y in 2019. The services producing industries also reported a 6.9% y-o-y fall in output in 2020, after expanding by 2.0% y-o-y in 2019. Advance estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (“MTI”) on 14 April 2021 showed the Singapore economy is on the mend after GDP posted a marginal uptick of 0.2% y-o-y in 1Q21, ending three consecutive quarters of contractions. The manufacturing sector which grew 7.5% y-o-y remained the primary growth driver, while both the construction and services producing industries recorded smaller y-o-y output declines in 1Q21. In its April 2021 monetary policy statement, the Monetary Authority of Singapore expects Singapore’s 2021 GDP to exceed the upper end of MTI’s forecast of between 4.0% and 6.0%. 2021’s GDP growth is foreseen to be gradual and uneven due to downside risks such as the trajectory of the global economic recovery and the course that the COVID-19 pandemic will take. RECENT GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND MEASURES AFFECTING THE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY MARKET COVID-19 Support Measures In 2020, the Government of Singapore announced support packages with a total worth of approximately SGD 105 billion to help Singapore’s businesses and individuals cope with the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The key COVID-19 support measures applicable to the industrial property sector, which have, to some extent, helped mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the industrial property market in 2020 are summarised in the table below. (See",
    "2": "Table 1) Initiatives to Drive Transformation and Future Growth Although Singapore started its industry transformation strategy in 2016 through the launch of 23 Industry Transformation Maps (“ITMs”) to increase productivity, develop skills, drive innovation, and promote internationalisation, COVID-19 has accentuated the need to accelerate these efforts. Performance Key COVID-19 Support Measures for the Industrial Property Market Support Measure Details Rental Waivers/ Reliefs The intention of the rental relief framework is to help as many businesses as possible weather the COVID-19-related economic fallout through rental waivers borne by the government and landlords. Tenants continue to pay maintenance fees and service charges. Eligible industrial tenants in government-owned/managed facilities received a total of two months of rental waiver. Eligible small and medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) tenants in private industrial properties received one month of rent relief (supported by the government) for April 2020. This was made up of a 30% property tax rebate (equivalent to about 0.36 month of rent) and cash grant (about 0.64 month of rent). SME tenants who further qualified for the Additional Rental Relief received another month of rent relief for May 2020, borne by landlords. COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 On 7 April 2020, the Ministry of Law (“MinLaw”) passed the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 to offer temporary relief to businesses and individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Act took effect on the same day and has since been amended thrice in June, September and November 2020. The Act allows businesses and individuals to defer certain contractual obligations, such as paying rent, repaying loans or completing work, for a specified period. It also ensures that property owners pass on property tax rebates in full to tenants. On 12 October 2020, MinLaw announced the extension of the relief period under Part 2 of the Act, which enables parties",
    "3": "in prescribed categories of contracts to obtain temporary relief from legal and enforcement actions for inability to perform contractual obligations due to COVID-19 by one to five months, depending on the contract category. The relief periods for selected contracts were extended further by MinLaw on 16 November 2020. Specifically, relief covering leases and licences of industrial properties ended on 19 November 2020, while the specified period for construction contracts or supply contracts was extended from 19 October 2020 to 31 March 2021. For Options to Purchase and Sale and Purchase Agreements between developers and purchasers of industrial properties, the prescribed relief period has been extended to 31 March 2021 to help industrial property buyers who require more time to make payments. It will also allow developers and purchasers to seek temporary protection from being sued during the relief period, if they are unable to perform any contractual obligations due to COVID-19. Jobs Support Scheme (“JSS”) The JSS was introduced to help save Singapore citizens’ and permanent residents’ jobs by providing wage support to employers during the period of economic uncertainty. The length and extent of support varies for different industries and depends on the severity of the impact from COVID-19.

JTC Policy Changes for Replacement Anchor Tenants JTC revised its policy on the replacement of anchor tenants for third-party facility providers (e.g., REITs) to better meet the changing needs of industries and help streamline the application process.

(See Table 2) ISLANDWIDE LOGISTICS/ WAREHOUSE MARKET OVERVIEW Existing Supply, Demand and Occupancy As of 1Q21, Singapore had 119.9 million sq ft of logistics/warehouse space, of which 97.6% was held by the private sector and 2.4% by the public sector. Due to COVID-19-related project delays, total net new supply was less than envisaged, amounting to only about 1.0 million sq ft in 2020, or less than a third of 2019’s total net new supply of 3.2 million sq ft. On the other hand, demand for logistics/warehouse space was healthy, underpinned by renewals and increased activity involving short-term leases to accommodate medical and food supplies, as well as consumer items (e.g., from e-retailers) following a spike in Ecommerce activities and increased stockpiling requirements. For example, Ecommerce players such as RedMart, Shopee Express and J&T Express took up more warehouse space in 2020, while Zuellig Pharma Singapore expanded its existing office and warehouse space to cater to the growing healthcare needs of the local market. This contributed to the near tripling in net space absorption from 1.1 million sq ft in 2019 to 3.1 million sq ft in 2020, albeit still less than the ten-year (2010 to 2019) average of 3.7 million sq ft per annum. As total net space absorption exceeded total net space additions in 2020, the islandwide average logistics/ warehouse occupancy rate was lifted from 88.0% as of 4Q19, to 89.9% as of 4Q20 – its highest level in five years. Demand remained healthy in 1Q21, underpinned by requirements from firms in Ecommerce, medical-related and food storage/logistics businesses. With net space absorption of 0.6 million sq ft almost on par with net space additions",

(See Exhibit 1) To prepare for the post-COVID-19 economy, an Emerging Stronger Taskforce (“EST”) was set up in May 2020 to provide recommendations to the Future Economy Council (“FEC”). The EST will work with the six FEC Clusters (Manufacturing, Built Environment, Trade & Connectivity, Essential Domestic Services, Modern Services and Lifestyle) on their industry transformation strategies, considering the changes that COVID-19 will have on the global economy and on Singapore.1 In line with this, there are plans to promote Singapore’s status as a regional and global Ecommerce hub. Besides introducing two nationwide 5G networks by 2025 to enable infrastructure capacity to deal with large online sales orders internationally, other key initiatives include working with businesses to build strong supply-chain capabilities, including developing value-added and specialised capabilities in areas such as cold-chain management, retail and pharmaceutical logistics. The government will support local businesses in gaining Ecommerce capabilities and maximising their growth opportunities from the digital economy.2 These initiatives could transform business-operating models, generate new business ideas and yield new industrial space requirements within the manufacturing cluster, as well 1 Source: Future Economy Council’s media release published on 6 May 2020. 2 Source: The Straits Times, “Singapore outlines plan to be hub for Ecommerce”, published on 29 Jan 2021.

Source: JTC, JLL Research Table 2 Overview Performance Governance Sustainability Financial 79 Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2020/2021 Potential Supply An estimated 7.9 million sq ft3 (net floor area) of new logistics/warehouse space is expected to be completed from 2Q 2021 to 2024, based on JTC’s latest list of projects in the pipeline as of 1Q21 and JLL’s research. Of this, JLL estimates that around 45.6% are single-user premises intended mostly for self-use, and 54.4% are multiple- user spaces. Without considering stock withdrawals and change of use, this will raise the islandwide stock as of 1Q21 by 6.6%, to around 128 million sq ft by end-2024. By expected year of completion, new supply is projected to surge to a peak of about 4.6 million sq ft in 2021 (inclusive of net additions in 1Q21) as COVID-19-related construction disruptions pushed back the completion of projects from 2020. Thereafter, new supply is foreseen to taper to 1.7 million sq ft and 1.1 million sq ft in 2022 and 2023, respectively, and to rise to 1.3 million sq ft in 2024. On average, the annual projected new supply of about 2.2 million sq ft from 2021 (full year) to 2024 is around half the average annual net new supply of 4.3 million sq ft witnessed in the four years from 2017 to 2020. (See Exhibit 2 and Table 3) 3 Potential supply includes space under construction and planned. However, the actual level of new supply could change due to amendments to the estimated gross floor area, as well as the status of planned projects.

As of 1Q21, the median price stood at SGD 479 per sq ft. The limitations of median prices derived from a small number of transactional records in a non-homogeneous market for trend analysis should be noted. (See Exhibit 4) Major Investment Sales Based on information collated by JLL Research as of 19 April 2021, an estimated SGD 0.26 billion worth of warehouses (excluding development sites)4 changed hands in 2020 for at least SGD 5 million apiece. This was lower than the SGD 0.54 billion amassed in 2019. Notable deals in 2020 include the sale of 7 Bulim Street, a four-storey ramp-up logistics facility with ancillary office space on each level, by Titan (Wenya) Pte Ltd to AIMS APAC REIT for SGD 129.63 million and PGIM’s purchase of Luxasia Building at 12 Tai Seng Street for SGD 66.09 million. Another SGD 0.19 billion worth of warehouses were transacted in 1Q21 on the back of higher investor interest given the sector’s resilient performance and strong demand in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(See Table 4) Market Outlook Stockpiling and Ecommerce needs, as well as food and vaccine storage/ logistics requirements, are foreseen to be key logistics/warehouse demand drivers in the near-term, amid expectations of a protracted fight against COVID-19. Singapore’s continued progression towards higher value-adding and value-creating manufacturing activities, such as R&D, specialty chemicals and additive manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing), is expected to underpin end- user demand for higher-specification and specialised logistics/warehouse facilities, like chemical warehouses and cold rooms. Rents Despite the improvement in the average islandwide logistics/ warehouse occupancy rate, JTC’s warehouse rental index, which is based on private warehouse transactions, fell for the seventh consecutive year in 2020. While the 1.3% y-o-y fall in the rental index was steeper than the 0.9% and 0.2% declines in 2018 and 2019, respectively, it was milder than the 1.6% to 6.4% declines from 2014 to 2017. This was even though 2020 saw Singapore experiencing its worst economic recession since independence, indicating the resilience in rent. In line with the improving economy and sustained healthy demand, JTC’s warehouse rental index rose by 0.5% from 4Q20 to 1Q21. According to data from J-Space, the islandwide 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile warehouse rents of leasing transactions in 1Q21 stood at SGD 1.40, SGD 1.80 and SGD 2.45 per sq ft per month, respectively.

However, there is potential that stockpiling requirements will taper off when the COVID-19 situation stabilises or is contained. More efficient operations from automated warehouses could also lower the need to expand physical real estate footprints to cater to business expansion. Considering the above and the foreseen economic recovery in 2021, we expect Singapore’s quantum of occupied logistics/warehouse stock to continue rising in 2021. However, the surge in new logistics/warehouse supply in 2021 could weigh down the islandwide average occupancy rate and cap rent growth in 2021. For the medium-term, we expect the projected economic and manufacturing sector growth to lend support to logistics/ warehouse demand. As new supply is expected to be low, this should underpin rent growth. March 2021 Meanwhile, the transformation of the logistics industry is expected to gather momentum as more firms embrace Industry 4.0 practices and adopt automation and the Internet of Things (“IoT”) in preparation for the eventual post-COVID-19 rebound.

Affected by the pandemic and global lockdowns, which in turn hindered both air and sea freight, Hong Kong’s total exports of goods recorded a contraction of 2.8% year-on-year (“y-o-y”) in the first eleven months of 2020, while imports of goods fell by 5.0% over the same period. As one of the four pillars of the economy, trading and logistics accounted for 21.6% of GDP in terms of basic prices in 2019. (See Exhibit 1) Economic Forecasts According to FocusEconomics, Hong Kong’s real GDP will continue to decline by 2.5% in Q4/2020, before rebounding to positive growth from Q1/2021 onwards. With a forecast recovery of 4.6% growth in GDP",
    "15": "in 2021, Hong Kong’s real GDP is expected to grow within a range of 2.1% to 3.1% from 2022 to 2025. The more positive economic outlook for 2021 is based on a recovery in consumer demand due to gradual virus containment, as well as a more stable business environment when the border subsequently reopens later in the year. Any reversal of the virus situation or a revival of social unrest would call into question the positive outlook. COVID-19 Impact The outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 has evolved into a worldwide pandemic with a negative economic impact globally. According to the World Bank, the global economy contracted by 4.3% in 2020. The retail and hospitality sectors in Hong Kong were hardest hit, with retail sales plummeting by 25.3% over the first eleven months of 2020, while visitor arrivals plunged by 93.2% over the same period due to border closures, leading to a 60% decline in RevPAR across all hotels in Hong Kong. Against this backdrop, the local logistics sector was relatively unscathed with a moderate decline of 1.5% and 3.3% respectively in both total exports and imports reported in 2020. The various social distancing measures implemented as well as the emerging work-from-home (“WFH”) trend have accelerated ecommerce demand locally, with ecommerce revenue up by 32% in 2020 compared to a moderate growth rate of 22% in 2019, according to Statista. With surgical masks in high demand in the first half of 2020 and the dine-in prohibition after 6pm in place for most of the year, it came as no surprise that Food & Personal Care was the fastest growing category in 2020, registering a 43% y-o-y increase. The rise in ecommerce has benefited 3PLs handling online goods, thus increasing warehouse demand for ecommerce logistics. Exports and imports are both expected",

The overall stock distribution of warehouses shows a clear shift of warehouse facilities towards the northwest New Territories over the past two decades. Compared with 1994, Hong Kong Island and Kwun Tong warehouse stock declined by 26% and 25% respectively to 1.8 and 2.8 million sq ft IFA in 2019. However, stock in Tuen Mun / Yuen Long rose sharply from 1.4 million sq ft IFA in 1994 to 2.9 million sq ft IFA in 2019, a 104% increment. This shift was driven by the development of new infrastructure such as Container Terminal 9, HKIA, the River Trade Terminal, the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, being completed over the period. (See Table 1) Warehouse Supply, Take-up and Vacancy Looking at the overall warehouse market, new supply of warehouse space has rebounded over the past decade. While average annual supply over the period from 2006 to 2010 was 69,000 sq ft IFA, from 2011 to 2019, average annual supply increased to 521,000 sq ft IFA. 2019 saw no new supply being completed. From 2011 to 2019, eight warehouse projects were completed in Kwai Tsing, Yuen Long and Fanling, five of which (China Merchants Logistics Centre, China Resources International Logistics Centre, Goodman Interlink, SF Centre and Mapletree Logistics Hub Tsing Yi in Kwai Tsing) are built to modern warehouse standards. The confluence of several adverse developments in recent years, emanating from both external and",
    "18": "domestic sources, had negatively impacted logistics demand. Over the past decade, vacancy increased from 3.8% in 2011 to 6.4% in 2019. In particular, the US / China trade tensions, as well as local social unrest had derailed logistics demand in 2019, leading to a negative take-up of 622,000 sq ft IFA in the year. (See Exhibit 4) WAREHOUSE MARKET OVERVIEW Warehouse Stock1 by Category and Distribution Hong Kong’s warehouse stock has grown at a relatively low compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 0.5% per annum over the past 20 years. This is largely due to severe land constraints, resulting in a limited supply of sites for warehouse use. Modern warehouse stock accounted for 50% of total warehouse stock (40.5 million sq ft IFA) at the end of 2019, 2% (or 1.0 million sq ft IFA) of which is situated at Hong Kong’s International Airport (“HKIA”) at Chek Lap Kok. Modern warehouses have been developed over recent years and are managed by a few experienced developers and investors, including Goodman, Hutchison, Mapletree, China Merchants and Kerry, with a modern warehouse market share2 of 24%, 20%, 11%, 6% and 6% respectively.

Overall vacancy increased to 2.2% in Q4/2019 from a recent low of 1.2% in Q2/2018 due mainly to the recent US / China trade tensions which derailed the trading economy, as well as the social unrest which has affected inbound tourism from China with negative consequences for the local retail market and its associated logistics demand. Following the COVID-19 outbreak since the start of 2020, global supply chain has been disrupted with increasing difficulty to move cargoes around, thereby affecting the freight forwarding and cross-border distribution functions of logistics operators. As visitor arrivals dwindle due to border closure and with more social distancing measures implemented, the retail market suffered. The 3PLs serving the retail market were faced with slowing businesses, leading to shrinking warehouse space demand which pushed overall warehouse vacancy up to 4.1% in Q4/2020, before falling heavily back to 3.1% in Q1/2021 due to improving macros and major leasing deals being recorded. Against this backdrop, modern warehouse vacancy rose to 2.8% in Q4/2020 from 0.9% in Q4/2019, but declined slightly to 2.7% in Q1/2021 following an increasing number of renewals driven by proactive landlords reducing rents.

In particular, there has been a recent pick-up in logistics demand from air cargo transport, related to regional transshipment of high-value goods, cross border and local ecommerce logistics, as well as temperature-controlled products.

This report is limited to the matters stated in it and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated herein. Looking into 2021 and beyond, while the virus situation remains unpredictable, forecasted revival in global logistics; a potential rebound in the local retail market; rising ecommerce demand; and newly completed infrastructure should all contribute to brighter prospects for the local logistics market. This could lead to a potential rental rebound from Q2 onwards, following a stabilisation in the warehouse market in Q1. Modern warehouses are expected to benefit most as their specifications are more suitable to ecommerce operators and multinational 3PLs. We expect modern warehouse rents to rebound by 5% to 10% in 2021, while overall warehouses may see slower growth with higher vacancy. Areas benefiting from newly completed infrastructure, such as Liantang / Heung Yuen Wai Border Control Point in the North- eastern New Territories, as well as Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link linking up Tuen Mun South and Hong Kong International Airport, should also see improving demand prospects. Modern warehouses, which continued to record a 30% premium over overall rents in Q4/2020, have a brighter outlook in light of growth from cross- border ecommerce and the structural shift towards air freight and high value-added goods. As operational efficiencies and modern facilities are increasingly more crucial in the logistics sector, rents for modern warehouses are expected to post a relatively stronger performance compared to the overall market during the next four years. Variations in supply, though, will limit rental growth for modern warehouses in 2023 to 0%, will only be temporary. (See Table",
    "23": "3) In the medium- to long-term, the key demand drivers of modern warehouses include value-added transshipment, fast-moving local distribution, emerging ecommerce distribution (both local and regional) as well as cold storage needs. Most of these demand groups require large floor plates, high ceiling heights and extra floor loadings, which can only be found in modern warehouses located in strategic locations either close to the airport, container terminals, the border, or a combination of all. As these operators are often handling higher value goods in large volumes, they are willing to pay premium rents to acquire warehouses which suit their needs, thereby reaffirming the rental premiums of modern warehouses over their general counterparts. March 2021 subsequently the pandemic, have led to declining logistics demand, dampening modern warehouse rental growth in both 2019 and 2020. Renewals were more common in modern warehouses, as these corporate landlords, who are experienced at managing large portfolios, have been more proactive in reducing rents since the second half of last year due to the increasingly difficult operating environment. At the end of Q1/2021, average modern warehouse rents stood at HK$13.0 per sq ft gross, a 12.1% downward adjustment from Q2/2019. General warehouses, which are mainly owned by local individual landlords / industrialists, were slower in terms of marking their asking rents to market. At the end of Q1/2021, average overall warehouse rents stood at HK$10.9 per sq ft gross, a 10.5% decline from Q2/2019.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China’s real GDP grew by 2.3% year-on- year (“YOY”) in 2020 despite some volatility in the first quarter of 2020 due to the lockdown measures in face of the pandemic. With successful epidemic control alongside a series of economic stimulus measures and strong economic fundamentals, a fast recovery was seen in the second to fourth quarters. The fast rebound has allowed the country to emerge as an outlier among large economies at a time when the global economy was upended by the pandemic. Total imports and exports grew by 1.9% YOY while trade surplus recorded an expansion of 27.1% YOY. Factories in China promptly resumed operations once the coronavirus was largely stamped out whereas manufacturing activities worldwide were disrupted as the pandemic spreads to the rest of the world. This enabled China to produce and export mass quantities of medical and work-from-home equipment, which generated keen logistics demand. Foreign direct investment (“FDI”) and outbound direct investment (“ODI”) of The PRC continued to expand in 2020. FDI",
    "25": "was 8.6% higher than the ODI, indicating that foreign investments in The PRC outstripped capital outflow in spite of the US-China trade dispute and COVID-19 pandemic. In pursuit of sustainable long- term economic growth, The PRC’s economic rebalancing in recent years has led to a shift from an export- led to a domestic-driven economy. As a result, domestic consumption has become a key growth engine for the country. In 2020, domestic consumption accounted for 54.3% of The PRC’s economic growth, and continues to be the major driving force of economic growth for the seventh consecutive year. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, cities were placed under lockdown and the operation of most physical retail stores were suspended in the first quarter of 2020. As a result, it accelerated the growing trend of online shopping. Online retail sales rose by 10.9% YOY in 2020 against the backdrop of a 3.9% YOY contraction in overall retail sales. Consequently, online retail sales of physical goods as a proportion of overall retail sales increased to 24.9%, from 20.7% last year. The resurgence of coronavirus in some places poses uncertainties to the economic recovery of The PRC; however, the economy of The PRC remains optimistic especially after its extraordinary achievement in 2020 amid challenging times. According to the International Monetary Fund, the GDP of The PRC is expected to see a noticeable growth of 8.1% in 2021, outpacing the global GDP growth of 5.5%. The economy of The PRC remains resilient ahead supported by continued urbanisation and a rising middle class. The sustainable economic development plans laid out by the government will continue to stimulate domestic consumption and expansion of the tertiary industry. LOGISTICS MARKET OVERVIEW Demand Drivers Amid the US-China trade dispute and COVID-19 pandemic, demand for warehouse spaces remained robust due to the surge",
    "26": "in disposable income and consumption expenditure as well as the rapid expansion of ecommerce and 3rd party logistics (“3PLs”). Surging Disposable Income and Consumption Expenditure The urban consumption expenditure per capita of The PRC grew at a 5-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 4.8% in 2020, which is in line with the upward trend of urban disposable income per capita that grew at a 5-year CAGR of 7.0% in the same period. However, in comparison with the developed economies, the consumption expenditure per capita of The PRC, which is only about one- tenth of that of the US or one-eighth of that of Australia, still has significant room for improvement. In view of the pace of economic growth, urbanisation and rising disposable income, the consumption expenditure per capita of The PRC has a high growth potential, and will be one of the key drivers of logistics demand in the country. It is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% between 2021 and 2024, outpacing other developed economies such as Japan, Australia, South Korea, the US and Hong Kong with an expected CAGR below 5.0% across the same period.

Consumption patterns have been changing in the past few years due to economic development, Internet penetration and technology advancements. In 2020, The PRC continued to be the largest ecommerce market in the world with total ecommerce sales of RMB11,760 billion. Despite the size of the ecommerce market, ecommerce sales per capita in The PRC still has a",
    "27": "high growth potential, due to a comparatively lower Internet penetration rate of 70% as of 2020. (See Exhibit 1) During the COVID-19 outbreak, cities were placed under lockdown and the operation of most physical retail stores were suspended. As a result, consumers had no choice but to shift their consumption from offline to online. From daily necessities to high-end commodity goods, almost everything can be purchased online and this accelerated the growing trend of online shopping. While physical stores gradually began to resume normal operations following the containment of the COVID-19 virus, it is expected that a relatively strong growth in ecommerce will still continue amid increasing emphasis on social distancing. As online shopping becomes the trend, it also implies a sustainable demand for warehouses from the ecommerce sector. Rise of 3PLs While some ecommerce companies have their own logistics arms, most, if not all, still tend to outsource their logistics operations to 3PL service providers as it is more cost-effective. Revenue growth of 3PL service providers is evident from an increasing proportion of budget attributable to 3PL services by ecommerce retailers, which has risen from 66.0% in 2015 to 73.0% in 2020. Moreover, according to the State Post Bureau of The PRC, the annual volume of express delivery has risen to over 83 billion pieces in 2020, up by 31.2% YOY. 3PL firms definitely benefitted from a surge in demand for online shopping and medical goods, and witnessed a boost in revenues during this period. For instance, SF Express, one of the major 3PL providers in The PRC recorded revenue growth of about 35% YOY in 2020 amid the COVID-19 outbreak. With 3PL firms being a major warehouse space occupier, leasing demand for Grade A warehouses is expected to benefit from their growth. Supply Situation The Grade A warehouse",

Also, under the National Logistics Hub Distribution and Construction Plan advocated by the government, infrastructure improvement projects will continue to be rolled out to facilitate the development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Area, Yangtze River Delta Area and the Greater Bay Area into regional logistics hubs. Amid increasing cross-city and cross-border economic activities, logistics demand in the regions is expected to be strong. OUTLOOK The PRC announced a “dual circulation” strategy to reduce dependence on overseas markets and technology in 2020. With an aim to foster self- sufficiency and resilience, the strategy is expected to become a key priority in the government’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025). The PRC will rely mainly on “internal circulation” for its development, which is the domestic cycle of production, distribution and consumption supported by innovation and upgrades in the economy. The authorities endeavour to boost tech innovation, push Chinese firms up the global value chain, boost household incomes, and in turn, further stimulate domestic consumption.

Travel restrictions in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic had also led to severe disruptions to the supply chains in the beginning of 2020. Since then, many companies worldwide have started to revisit their inventory management strategies. In order to minimise disruption risk from geographical uncertainties, companies are considering a switch from the traditional just-in-time strategy, which strives to keep as little inventory as possible, to the just-in-case strategy, which relies on having surplus inventory. For instance, Parkson Retail Group Limited, which manages a network of department stores and retail operations across 27 cities in The PRC, recorded an inventory growth of 16% YOY in the first half of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The inventory of retailers is anticipated to grow by 10%-15% serving as a buffer in case of disruptions to the supply chain. The warehouse market is expected to benefit from the increasing demand for storage space driven by this trend. With regard to the aforesaid drivers, the Grade A warehouse market in The PRC shall continue to grow in the future years and is considered to be relatively resilient amid the COVID-19 global pandemic.

    "34": "2020, with a year-on-year growth of 22.9% and 11.7% registered for the third and fourth quarter respectively, driven by a rebound in domestic consumption and exports. However, this was insufficient to offset weakness in the first half of the year when the Covid-19 pandemic impacted the global economy. Consequently, Japan’s economy shrank 4.0% over the full year, its first contraction since 2009. Logistics real estate market Market Overview In Japan, developers of large-scale leased logistics facilities supplied a cumulative total of approximately 32,760,000 m2 in gross floor area (“GFA”) as at the end of December 2020. Despite COVID-19 bringing almost all economic activity to a standstill in the first half of 2020, demand for warehouse continued to outpace annual supply. Annual supply nationwide was approximately 3,820,000 m2, while demand was approximately 4,110,000 m2. The pre-commitment rate for the following year’s supply as at end 2020 was 57%1, a sharp increase as compared to 43% a year ago. (See Exhibit 1) While the logistics industry enjoyed a boom in 2018 and 2019 which led to a strong demand for logistics real estate, the industry was negatively impacted by COVID-19 in 2020. However, the impact was mitigated by a pick-up in demand from Ecommerce. Consequently, in all four major areas of Greater Tokyo, Greater Osaka, Greater Nagoya and Fukuoka, vacancy rates of large-scale leased logistics facilities remain low, while rents continued to trend up. - Reasons behind vigorous demand Demand is driven by advance leasing from Ecommerce-related companies and leasing from manufacturer shippers who are consolidating premises, as well as continued leasing demand from 3PL providers. Ecommerce is the most significand demand driver, with Ecommerce-related demand expected to account for about 30% of total demand in 2020 and 2021, up from around 10% in 2019. - Reasons behind increase in supply Nationwide,",
    "35": "approximately 4,000,000 m2 of supply came onto the market between 2018 and 2020. Looking ahead, annual supply is estimated to be about 5,000,000 m2 in 2021 and 20222. One likely reason for the increase in new supply is the rise in the number of developers for logistics real estate. Covid-19 has led to greater investor interest in logistics real estate and as a result, the industry has attracted new players such as traditional residential developers into the market.

In fact, occupancy rates at logistics facilities that handle food and beverage products were high. Trend in rents Supported by firm demand, vacancy rate in all four major areas fell during 2020 while rent levels continued to trend up. Assuming a base year of 2013 with a rent level of 100, rental levels in Greater Tokyo and Osaka have trended upwards to 104.8 in 2018, 114.8 in 2019, and 128.8 in 2020. Rents showed a significant rise in 2019 and 2020. Notably, several new rental facilities in prime locations with high rents (approximately JPY 6,000 or more monthly per tsubo) were completed during 2020, and all of them are now fully leased. (See Exhibit 3) Trend in cap rates The cap rates for logistics real estate had declined nearly every year since 2011, to levels that are significantly below those seen prior to the Global Financial Crisis. As of October 2020, the cap rate for multi-tenant facilities in the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas was 4.4% and 4.95% respectively. Cap rates had held steady for some time but started to fall since April 2020, along with a rise in demand for logistics real estate due to the Covid-19 crisis. In many cases, cap rate has fallen below 4% on an NOI basis. In addition, it is not just the newly developed properties but existing income-generating facilities were also well-appraised and transacted at low cap rates.

Main Demand and Supply Factors Demand Factors - Growing demand for last mile delivery logistics The surge in demand for warehouse space from Ecommerce-related companies is not just driven by the need for storage and distribution facilities but also for home delivery bases. For example, Amazon is establishing delivery stations (“DS”) all around Japan.

Supply Factors - Differentiation between developed facilities In response to the rising number of developed properties, developers are proactively introducing differentiation to their properties. In addition to tangible differentiation such as the adoption of seismically isolated and damping structures, special design of exterior walls, provision of day-care facilities and other amenities for employees (such as clean restrooms), effort is now being put into intangible differentiation through services that provide solutions to issues faced by tenants, such as human resource referrals, truck standby systems, and consultancy on installation of material handling equipment within a facility. Such approaches are mainly adopted by large-scale developed properties and developed properties with multiple buildings, while small- and medium-sized stand-alone developed properties focus on provision of modern-spec functionalities. - Expansion of radius for potential development sites A rate of JPY 3,500 to 3,800 per tsubo per month is the rent level that 3PL providers consider as reasonable. Rising rents in the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas are making it more difficult to secure rental space within this range, especially in areas close to the city center.

Supply is also projected to be the largest ever in the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas. In 2020, bids were sought for sites eligible for development all around the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas and developers made the most of their individual networks to acquire sites. Given this situation, supply is likely to continue to be high at about 5,000,000 m2 or more for some time. Outlook for Demand Supported by demand from Ecommerce related businesses, demand for logistics real estate is expected to remain firm and likely to keep pace with the high level of supply. The pre-commitment rate3 for 2021 as at the end of 2020 was about 57% on a nationwide basis, with high rates of 52% in the Greater Tokyo area and 72% in the Osaka area. In addition, the vacancy rate as at the end of 2020 was low. - Ecommerce-related",

Viewed by product type, food and beverage products have a low penetration rate of 2.89%, while household furniture, books, sundry household goods, office supplies, etc. have higher penetration rates of 20% to 40%. Outlook for Supply-Demand Balance (See Exhibit 5) - Outlook for 2021 With a high pre-commitment rate and the expected growth in Ecommerce-related demand, there is unlikely to be an extreme deterioration in the supply-demand balance, even if macroeconomic weakness continues to impact the logistics industry. Overall rental rates are expected to hold steady or firm up, especially for the prime locations. - 2022 and Beyond In the short term, Ecommerce related demand is expected to grow and sustain demand for logistics facilities. However, there remains uncertainties over the pace of economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the longer term, it is likely to arise relocation demands due to aging of the existing warehouses. Trends in the Logistics Real Estate Market in the Main Economic Zones Greater Tokyo area The vacancy rate continued its downward trend since 2015, falling to approximately 1.3% by the end of 2020. The supply-demand balance is tight, and pre-commitment on developed properties prior to their completion is growing as the shortage of vacant space intensifies. In 2020, supply of approximately 2,660,000 m2 was met with demand of approximately 2,830,000 m2, as demand continues to strengthen further. In areas where large-scale development is taking place, such as Sagamihara and Nagareyama districts, and even for properties with high rents, leasing was buoyant. In the bayside area and inland areas around Atsugi, Kashiwa and Tokyo, vacancy rates have remained low while rents have risen dramatically over 2020. Looking ahead, supply in 2021 is projected to exceed that for 2020 and may be the largest ever. Despite the",
    "41": "large volume of supply and the potential economic weakness weighing on the logistics sector, the vacancy rate in 2021 is likely to remain low, supported by strong demand from Ecommerce. It is likely that rents will continue to rise firmly in many districts. On the other hand, new development properties which try to capture demands from other regions or properties which set higher rent than market, leasing activities are likely to be very competitive, in result more properties may offer a generous range of incentives. Osaka area A limited supply in 2018 through 2020 coupled with strong demand led to a decline in vacancy rate to 3.9% by the end of 2020. In the inland area where demand is strong, the vacancy rate is 0%. While supply is expected to be the largest ever in 2021, pre-commitment rate has reached 72%. In the inland area, vacancy rates hovered at nearly 0% from 2018 through 2020. Against this background, rents have remained firm. With road improvements such as the Shin-Meishin Expressway and Second Keihan Highway, there is a rapid expansion of the radius within which logistics facilities are being developed. In the bayside area, there are signs of demand returning due to the widening difference in rent compared with the inland area and the shortage of vacant space in the inland area. The supply-demand balance in Osaka, which was for a time seen as a high-risk area due to oversupply, has tightened in recent years. Although supply in 2021 is projected to be the largest ever, the pre-commitment rate is quite high, so there is limited likelihood that the supply-demand balance will deteriorate markedly.

Although there is unrealised potential in Ecommerce- related demand, demand conditions are slightly different from those in the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas. The vacancy rate is likely to fall by the end of 2021 due to the limited supply throughout the year. However, the increase in supply projected for 2022 and beyond may lead to a deterioration in the supply-demand balance. Rents may plateau or, in the medium term, even soften. Other areas - Sendai metropolitan area The scale of demand in the Sendai metropolitan area is relatively small, at about 1/20 that of the Greater Tokyo area. Ongoing demand for warehouse is driven by the reconstruction of the region following the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. The development of facilities continued in inland areas such as Izumi, Tomiya and Medeshimadai in Natori City. This was followed by a resurgent increase in developments in seaside areas. Built-to-suit (BTS) developments are numerous in this area, but there are also multi-tenant facilities. However, reconstruction demand has weakened recently, while rents are also plateauing. - Sapporo metropolitan area Within the Sapporo metropolitan area, Sapporo City and surrounding districts are promising areas for logistics facilities. Development was previously limited to only built-to- suit in this area, but development of multi-tenant facilities in Higashikariki and Wattsu industrial park is gathering pace.

The economy recorded a marginal negative growth of 1.0% YOY in 2020, outperforming the majority of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) countries, as its large manufacturing industry, well-established online shopping base, and pandemic-response measures buoyed its economy. Modest quarter- on-quarter(“QOQ”) declines of -1.3% and -3.2% in the first two quarters of 2020 were subsequently followed by two strong quarters of recovery at 2.1% and 1.2% QOQ growth. As of year-end 2020, South Korea has ranked the top tenth largest economy across the globe in terms of gross domestic product, surpassing Brazil, Italy, and Russia. The relatively positive outlook of South Korea’s economy has attracted foreign investors looking for investment opportunities in a resilient market. Amid the economic downturn, government spending has risen significantly in an attempt to keep the economy afloat. In 2020, the government increased its budgeted spending by KRW66.8 trillion (USD59.9 billion) through four rounds of supplementary budgets. This is the first time in nearly 60 years that the government initiated four rounds of supplementary budgets in a single year. The government has allocated a total budget of KRW277 trillion in financial stimulus packages to boost the virus-hit economy. The government’s fiscal support is expected to continue through 2021. In December 2020, the National Assembly approved the 2021 budget of KRW558 trillion, a 9% increase on",
    "46": "the 2020 original budget (KRW512 trillion). The government plans to spend 72.4% of the budget within the first half of 2021 in order to serve the most urgent needs resulting from prolonged pandemic. Going forward, the country’s economy is expected to pick up with a real GDP growth forecast of 3.3% in 2021 and 3.1% in 2022 according to the OECD Economic Outlook March 2021. These projections are in line with the average forecast of 5.6% and 4.0% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, for the OECD countries, considering the impact of the underlying base effect on the rebound of other countries. Ecommerce and Grade A Logistics Facilities Benefit During Pandemic The demand for modern logistics properties continues to be strong, mainly driven by the robust growth of the Ecommerce sector. Total Ecommerce volume reached KRW159 trillion in 2020, an increase of approximately 16.7% year-on-year (“YOY“), and accounting for about one- third of total retail sales volume. This comes after the Ecommerce market surged at an annual growth rate of 20% or higher during 2016 and 2019. Of particular note, mobile sales have expanded dramatically at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 49% from 2013 to 2020. The prolonged pandemic and social distancing measures have changed the market as well. Annual contactless deliveries of fresh foods and services and home appliances saw 53% and 44% YOY growth in 2020, respectively. This demands faster delivery times and therefore leads to quicker turnover of goods and higher utilisation rate of logistics facilities. In order to cater to the growing online demand, major retailers are restructuring their business models. Naver, one of the two major internet platform providers in South Korea, partnered with CJ Logistics to expand its online sales within the platform; while Amazon also entered the market partnering with SK Telecom.",
    "47": "Major offline retail service providers such as Lotte and Shinsegae are also tapping into online sales platforms. As Ecommerce operators provide same-day or next-day services for high volumes of deliveries and often for fresh goods, mega-scale modern facilities with automation processes, cold chain facilities and fulfilment centres in strategic locations benefitted from a heightened leasing demand. Aged, low-profile and non- core location warehouses are losing their competitive edge, requiring refurbishment or even redevelopment. Existing Stock and Future Pipeline in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) In recent years, there have been more developments of sizeable and high- quality logistics facilities to meet the needs of occupiers (logistics service providers and retailers). According to the Building Registry of Korea and Colliers research, 25 new logistics warehouses were added in the SMA during 2020, amounting to about 1.7 million sq m. As at the end of 2020, logistics centres located in the SMA provided about 21.3 million sq m of gross floor area, representing about 8% CAGR over the past ten years. Total stock in the SMA is expected to grow by another 1.7 million sq m and 2.4 million sq m in 2021 and 2022, respectively. However, the number of expected developments has decreased from previous years, indicating a smaller number of developments but with a larger scale. As location becomes increasingly more important to enable faster deliveries, traditional logistics hub cities located in Southeast Gyeonggi- do near major highways continue to be the top priority for developers, accounting for nearly 37% of the total stock in the SMA. The latest additions to the Southeast submarket are Yangji Arenas Logistics Centre and Kendall Square Namsa.

Supported by strong demand for modern facilities, certain Grade A developments completed in 2020 were also able to either secure tenants for 100% of space during the pre-leasing stage prior to completion or keep absorption period to within one quarter upon its completion. Despite the massive inflow of logistics supply built between 2018 and 2020, which represents in total around 23% of total stock as at the end of 2020, market sentiment remains strong supported by low vacancy rates and ample demand in the market.

The average cap rate for logistics facilities has continued to compress since 2014, and as market maturity hastened in the past three years, the spread between the SMA Logistics assets and the Seoul Office has narrowed to 110 basis point as at the end of 2020. The total transaction volume of logistics facilities rose to a record high of about KRW2.6 trillion, as investors gained confidence in the underlying fundamentals as well as potential strong investment returns of the logistics asset class. The gap in cap rates for grade A logistics centres in key locations and non- core logistics assets in secondary locations has widened further. Recently completed modern warehouses with credible tenants in Yongin and Icheon indicated about 80 to 100 basis point compression compared to the previous year. For instance, BRIC Logistics, Doji Logistics and Dancheon-ri Logistics were sold with record low cap rates of 4.5% to 4.8%. Non-core assets were transacted at the high 5% to high 6% range and were only 20 to 30 basis point down from the previous year.

Australia’s economic growth had been fostered by low interest rates and the depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013, therefore driving higher export volumes. The COVID-19 containment measures led to a sharp drop in Australia’s GDP over 2Q20 (-7.0%), leading to Australia’s first recession since 1991, following a 0.3% decline in 1Q20. However, the economy rebounded strongly in second half of the year on the back of the government’s unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus programmes. Income support policies (such as the JobKeeper program – extended to March 2021, and JobSeeker) have supported consumption expenditure, particularly within the non- discretionary retail sector and online retail platform. Australia’s fiscal policy response to COVID-19 has been one of the highest in the world (11.5% of GDP). The 2020-21 Federal Budget further provides economic stimulus, mainly in the form",
    "54": "of personal income tax cuts and business investment incentives including wage subsidies. The proactive approach to managing the health crisis, led to most parts of the Australian economy reopening ahead of expectations. Australia exited technical recession with quarterly GDP growth of 3.4% recorded in 3Q20 and 3.1% in 4Q20, translating to a full year economic contraction of 1.1% for 2020. GDP of Australia’s major trading partners is forecast to grow by around 6% in 2021 and 4% in 2022. As a result of the various policy support measures and the successful management of the health crisis, Australia’s GDP growth projection is expected to rebound in 2021. According to the Reserve Bank of Australia (“RBA”) in its November 2020 release: GDP growth is forecast to increase to 6% by June 2021 then slightly fall to 5% by the end of 2021. Unemployment rate is forecast to marginally decline to 7.5% in mid- 2021 and trend downwards to 6.5% by the end of 2021. Underlying inflation is expected to increase from -0.3% in June 2020 to 2.25% in June 2021. Over the long-term, two of the most relevant economic variables that global real estate investors refer to for benchmarking Australia to other global economies are: GDP and population growth. The longer-term economic and population growth outlook is favourable for Australia relative to other mature economies. Oxford Economics projects Australia’s GDP growth will average 2.8% per annum between 2020 and 2030 – well above the economic growth rate for most other mature economies. In the short-term, Australia’s population growth will be negatively impacted by international border closures. However, the Federal Government has retained a commitment to a high migration program which will support population growth over the medium to long-term. Over the period from 2020 to 2030, Oxford Economics project Australia’s population will",

INDUSTRIAL AND LOGISTICS SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND TREND The Australian industrial and logistics sector, albeit impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, is supported by very strong property fundamentals including low vacancies, limited speculative development activity, relatively strong occupier demand, and growing investor appetite. These fundamentals will continue to drive the resilient performance of industrial and logistics assets. Pricing for core assets with strong covenants and long WALEs is expected to remain firm, while demand for secondary grade assets with leasing vulnerabilities is comparatively lower. The sector has been the most resilient of the mainstream commercial property sectors amid COVID-19. The resilience of the industrial & logistics sector is largely explained by high quality covenants in institutional grade assets and confidence in the ability to collect income. Industrial & logistics rent collection rates have remained high across most mature economies. The industrial & logistics sector has shown low volatility of returns through the cycle (rolling five-year average). In the COVID-19 economic downturn, return volatility remained low and has not experienced the same upward movement as the retail and, to a lesser extent, office sectors. (See Exhibit 1) The sector is exposed to a diverse range of growth drivers. A number of these factors were evident and having a positive influence even prior to COVID-19. COVID-19 has accelerated some of these existing growth trends for the industrial and logistics sector in 2020. Growth sectors backed by strong fundamentals include transport and logistics, eCommerce, food logistics and manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals. The structural eCommerce tailwind is relatively immature in Australia and is expected to further fuel the trajectory of growth. The share of online retail trade to total retail trade currently stands at 13.2% (as at February 2021, according to NAB), which is a significant jump from 9.3% in January 2020.",
    "56": "Accelerated eCommerce adoption will require greater supply chain investments, especially for sectors with low internet penetration such as the grocery sector. (See Exhibit 2) Overview Performance Governance Sustainability Financial 101 Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2020/2021 Output from the transport and storage sectors grew by 1.6% during 2019 and is projected to increase at an annual average rate of 2.0% between 2020 and 2025 (Source: Deloitte Access Economics), driven by solid growth in the demand for goods, on the back of strong projected population growth. Since 2015, Australia’s gross annual industrial floorspace take-up has remained consistently above the 10-year annual average of 2.2 million sqm. Occupier take-up activity peaked in 2020, equating to 2.86 million sqm – the highest JLL has ever recorded. This trend has continued in 2021, with Q1 gross take-up reaching a new benchmark of 1.1 million as per JLL Research data. (See Exhibit 4) in capacity growth between 2018 and 2020 in comparison to historic benchmarks. However, Australia’s cold store capacity per urban resident has been unable to keep up with population growth. As at 2020, to reach the average for a mature economy, Australia would have to build an additional 1.9 million cubic metres of refrigerated warehousing space –equivalent to an additional 23% of current stock levels. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), non-discretionary retail trade in Australia has been increasing, recording an average year- on-year growth rate of 3.3% over the past few years. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the growth rate has stepped up, and continues to climb, currently at an all-time high of 12.6% (as at February 2021, ABS).

New transport infrastructure will continue to support the logistics sector and in turn, demand for industrial space. (See Exhibit 6) The pandemic will have long term implications on how supply chains are structured, as they will need to develop to mitigate external risk and become more resilient. There are three trends that may arise from this, all of which result in the demand for space: Reshoring / near sourcing of manufacturing – particularly for higher value-add manufacturing activity, such as those related to the healthcare sector.

JLL projects the national Gross State Product-weighted Industrial & Logistics rent index will increase by 3.4% per annum from 2022 to 2029. It is important to put this rate of growth in the context of a low inflation environment. Deloitte Access Economics forecasts Australia’s underlying CPI will be 2.3% between 2020 and 2029. (See Exhibit 8) The risks to the inflation outlook are to the downside as CPI has only averaged 1.5% per annum over the past four years (2017 to 2020). Therefore, the Australian Industrial & Logistics sector has the potential to deliver real (inflation-adjusted) rental growth of between 100 and 150 basis points over the next 10 years. Industrial property has emerged as a mature, institutional grade investment sector, and plays a vital role in a diversified portfolio. The Australian industrial sector remains one of the most sought-after sectors, by both domestic, regional and global capital sources, as it is underpinned by stable long-term factors. In 2020, approximately AUD 4.4 billion in investment sales occurred nationally (for sales AUD 10 million and over), illustrating the resilience of the sector during the pandemic period.

This will be aided by the underlying strength of the Sydney market, in terms of both occupier demand outlook and rental growth relative to the inflation rate, for the foreseeable future.

The North precinct has become more active with its share of gross take-up increasing to 28.0% in 2020, which was well above the five- year average of 16.7%. (See Exhibit 13) Major deals recorded from these sectors over 2020 include: CSL Group (Manufacturing), which pre-committed to a 118,000 sqm high tech facility in the North for the production of vaccines, underscoring the growing importance of the healthcare sector on the demand for industrial & logistics floorspace. Uniqlo (Retail Trade) pre-leased a new 46,000 sqm facility in the West and Linfox (Transport, Postal and Warehousing) leased a 34,000 sqm cold storage facility in response to the surging demand from online grocery. In 2021, occupier activity in Melbourne reached a new benchmark, totalling 546,940 sqm; the highest that JLL Research has ever recorded for the market. This accounted for 49% of national gross take-up for the quarter and was driven by the Transport, Postal & Warehousing (29%), Retail Trade (20%) and Manufacturing (18%) sectors. Supply A total of 794,300 sqm of industrial floorspace was delivered in 2020, the highest level recorded over the past decade. The development pipeline was under-written by a healthy level of pre-commitment. Approximately 80% of the Melbourne development pipeline was pre-leased upon practical completion.

Given the significant economic uncertainty in the market during much of last year, most developers were unwilling or unable to commence any non-committed projects. The dynamic has now created a short-term lag in new asset delivery, which will be remedied throughout 2021 in line with the re-commencing of new projects towards the end of last year. The development pipeline in the Melbourne industrial & logistics market is expected to continue to deliver above-average volumes of stock. We are currently tracking 696,570 sqm of new stock, which is either under construction or has approved plans and due to complete over the balance of 2021. Assuming these projects all reach completion at their currently scheduled times, 2021 will mark the highest volume of completions in the Melbourne market that JLL research has recorded. (See Exhibit 14) Prime Rents Melbourne is one of the most affordable industrial & logistics markets in Australia. Average prime rents are at AUD 94 psm p.a., unchanged over 2020, while secondary net rents were AUD 74 psm p.a. Record levels of occupier activity has started to place upward pressure on rental values in the Melbourne market, with average rates increasing by 0.9% (prime) and 0.4% (secondary) in 1Q21. Melbourne’s long-term prospects for strong population growth will continue to be a fundamental driver of growth for the industrial and logistics sector. As such, we have upgraded our rental growth forecasts for 2021 for Melbourne, with expectations of full- year growth of between 1-3%.

The Southern precinct is the largest (5.7 million sqm), incorporating the city fringe and the land-rich area south of Brisbane. The precinct has become better serviced by road and rail infrastructure over the last 10 years, resulting in a higher share of demand- led development activity. Demand Gross annual take-up in 2020 totalled 384,200 sqm, which is below the 10- year annual average of 448,600 sqm. Despite this, the number of leasing transactions remained in line with the 10-year average, with 52 deals recorded in 2020. This reflects that demand activity was led by smaller occupiers.

Early signs in 2021 suggest that the occupier market in Brisbane is beginning to recover, with first quarter totals in line with long-term averages for the first time in 12 months. Given that leasing volumes in the market are typically lower in the first quarter of the year, 1Q21 results are 18% above the 10-year first quarter average. Supply A total of 416,600 sqm of industrial floorspace was delivered in 2020, well above the 10-year annual average of 274,700 sqm. While 2020 was a significant year for new supply, the bulk of development activity was demand- led with over 75% pre-leased prior to practical completion. Like other markets, Brisbane recorded a record-low volume of completions in 1Q21. Only two projects, totaling 12,800 sqm of floorspace delivered in the first three months of 2021.

Overview Performance Governance Sustainability Financial 109 Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2020/2021 Malaysia by Knight Frank Malaysia MACRO ECONOMY OVERVIEW Gross Domestic Product and Inflation Rate The prolonged nationwide movement control order (MCO), implemented since 18 March 2020, and the subsequent phases of MCO coupled with the recent reinforced MCO 2.0 to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus had dealt a severe impact on the country’s economic performance. Measures such as travel restrictions, enforced business closures and restricted social activities curbed domestic activities, while businesses also had to contend with a sharp slowdown in external demand. The fresh wave of COVID-19 pandemic since September 2020 led to a sharp economic contraction in the fourth quarter with gross domestic product (GDP) shrinking by 3.4% in the fourth quarter, compared to -2.6% in the third quarter. Malaysia’s economy contracted by 5.6% for all of 2020, its worst performance since the Asian financial crisis and below the government’s earlier projection of -3.5% to",
    "71": "-5.5%. For 2021, the economy is expected to rebound between 6.0% and 7.5%, supported mainly by the recovery of economic and trade activities globally and domestically. As the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines gets underway, more business activities and services sector are allowed to reopen during the current phase of MCO 2.0 subject to conditions and standard operating procedures (SOPs) set by the relevant authorities. (See Exhibit 1) Malaysia registered a deflation (-1.2%) in 2020, the first time in five decades, primarily due to lower global oil and commodity prices coupled with tiered electricity tariff rebate since April 2020 and suppressed domestic demand amongst other factors. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has projected that headline inflation will average higher to 2.5% in 2021, mainly due to improved global oil prices. The central bank cut the overnight policy rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 1.75% on 7 July 2020, its fourth revision in 2020 to provide a more accommodative monetary environment to support the country’s economy. The Malaysia’s Industrial Production Index (IPI), which nosedived to 76.5 points in April following the implementation of the nationwide MCO on 18 March, rebounded strongly to 114.8 points in June with the easing of restrictions. For the entire 2020, the IPI read at 109.8 points, lower by 4.2% y-o-y (2019: 114.6 points). Foreign Direct Investment Malaysia’s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) dipped 22.6% on the year, from RM82.9 billion in 2019 to RM64.2 billion in 2020, impacted by cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the manufacturing sector, despite the overall decline in FDI, some RM56.6 billion of FDI from 1,049 projects were approved in 2020, circa 3.9% higher compared to 2019.

    "73": "changes in consumer shopping behaviour, some of which are permanent and this continues to affect the retail sector as well as growth in the ecommerce industry. Many business-to-consumer (B2C) firms were forced to quickly adapt to offer online retailing services due to lockdowns and movement restrictions in many markets. The growth in the adoption of online retailing was evident in key markets across Asia-Pacific, averaging at circa 14% in 2020 compared to the previous year. Malaysia’s online retail sales grew by 17% in 2020, the third-fastest among the countries reviewed. Moving forward, there is much potential for higher growth as the country’s overall online penetration stands at only 5%. Higher ecommerce penetration rate will increase demand for warehousing space to meet the growth in last- mile delivery amid the structural shift towards omnichannel retailing.

The COVID-19 outbreak, which led to the implementation of various stages of MCO with stringent SOPs such as physical (social) distancing, temperature screenings and hygiene guidelines amongst others, have accelerated the sales of consumer goods through online channels with many late adopters of ecommerce trying out online shopping. Subsequently, retailers have also jumped onto the ecommerce bandwagon, increasing their online presence and reducing the presence of physical stores. Evidently, F&N has launched its own ecommerce site as well as smartphone application allowing its consumers to purchase its products at bulk and at competitive prices online. Ecommerce reconfigure the supply chain flows allowing goods to be distributed to the end-users directly from the warehouses / distribution centres, bypassing the physical stores. Meanwhile, Mastercard has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with MDEC on 2 September 2020 in a collaborative effort to enable ecommerce for micro, small-and- medium enterprises (MSMEs), on top of fostering financial inclusion in rural communities. Under the collaboration, Mastercard will work together with MDEC to support industry partners and facilitate the rollout of Mastercard payments and business technologies giving MSMEs the ready-made infrastructure they need, to kick-start in ecommerce. The exponential growth of ecommerce increases the demand for warehousing in more locations including non- central locations to serve the rural communities. The emerging trends also encourage logistics players to increase efficiency by digitalizing their operations and this has led to higher demand for smart warehousing and e-fulfilment centres. Presently, the logistics industry in Malaysia is fragmented with a large number of players across the value chain. Moving forward, we expect to see more vertical and horizontal consolidation among the logistics and ecommerce players",
    "80": "as they try to gain scale and expand their network. In tandem with rising trade, the industry is expected to grow by capitalising on the ecommerce wave. Another issue the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront is the concern surrounding supply chain security given how the supply of goods, material and labour were disrupted when the Chinese borders closed, severely hindering manufacturing output across the Asia-Pacific region. These concerns are not new as larger firms have started adopting a China- Plus-One model in recent years, where manufacturing operations are diversified out of the Chinese Mainland into more cost-effective markets such as Malaysia. Many smaller and medium sized enterprises, however, were caught off-guard when the pandemic hit. However, over the coming years, manufacturing reliance is set to shift away from the Chinese Mainland, and regions such as Southeast Asia and its industrial sector are set to be net beneficiaries. March 2021 Malaysia by Knight Frank Malaysia Performance Independent Market Research 114 Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2020/2021 Vietnam is the only ASEAN economy among the big six to register positive growth amid the pandemic, growing 2.9% in 2020 to be the fastest growing economy in the regional bloc. Effective containment of the pandemic has helped the country sustain growth, paving the way for an economic rebound in 2021. The country has targeted GDP in 2021 to grow by 6.5% while forecasts by international organizations are even higher at 6.5% as per IMF, 6.8% as per the World Bank and Asian Development Bank and 7.8% as per Oxford Economics. This positive outlook is based on the country’s stable economic conditions, improving business environment, developing infrastructure, sustained foreign investment as well as growing manufacturing and export sectors. Economic integration through free trade agreements, recently with EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (“EVFTA”) and the",
    "81": "upcoming Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (“RCEP”) will benefit Vietnam’s exports, create more jobs and reduce unemployment. This also helps Vietnam to become more competitive in attracting foreign investments. Vietnam rose 3 positions on the Agility Emerging Markets Logistics Index 2021, to rank 8th out of 50 emerging logistics markets in 2021, and third in Southeast Asia. The higher placing indicates growing capabilities of the logistics sector, which is integral to support growth in other industries like import-export, retail, ecommerce, industrial & manufacturing. VIETNAM WAREHOUSE MARKET In recent years, Vietnam’s industrial and warehouse market has benefited from the US-China trade war. The Covid-19 pandemic has also compelled companies to consider new locations to re-configure and diversify their supply chains to mitigate risks. These developments have underscored Vietnam’s attractiveness to foreign investors, due to its competitive advantage in areas such as favorable demographics, enhanced economic integration, preferential incentives from supportive government policies, an improving business environment and legal framework as well as rapid infrastructure improvements. This has resulted in total registered foreign direct investment (“FDI”) capital increasing by 8% p.a. on average over the past ten years. The increase in FDIs and manufacturing investments in Vietnam, together with the positive knock-on effects on domestic consumption and economic growth, have underpinned demand for logistics space. Additionally, the growth of domestic retail and ecommerce sectors have been propelling warehousing development in the past few years. To be specific, ecommerce revenue recorded an average growth of 30% p.a. from 2016 – 2019 and growth is expected to be sustained in 2020. Total retail sales of consumer goods and services also increased by 9% p.a. on average during the past 5 years. Particularly, the growing demand for convenience, such as on-demand delivery of fresh produce, has spurred the development of end-to-end cold- chain networks. Although currently",
    "82": "dominated by international third-party logistics service providers (“3PLs”), the Vietnam’s logistics market is witnessing a growing presence of local players including notable names such as Gemadept, Nhat Tin and Vinafco. Growing demand and interest from international investors to enter into joint ventures as well as a surge in merger and acquisitions have supported the growth of local companies. In the South, logistics facilities are concentrated in Ho Chi Minh City (“HCMC”), Long An, Dong Nai and Binh Duong. These are expected to mainly cater to the ecommerce, express, pharma, retail and manufacturing sectors. Upcoming infrastructure developments such as road networks between Hiep Phuoc, Cat Lai and Cai Mep ports, Long Thanh International Airport, will also contribute to improvements in connectivity and logistics efficiency. Binh Duong continues to be a leading logistics hub due to its large supply and sustained demand. Meanwhile, HCMC, Long An and Dong Nai have also emerged as alternative locations for logistics facilities with greater demand from distribution, ecommerce, pharma and chemical warehousing. Warehouses in most of these locations are expected to gradually start construction this year and operate in early 2022. Close to the new airport, the government has planned over 6,000 ha of industrial park (“IP”) including plans for a freight hub near ICD Long Binh. Long An has a strong pipeline of new IPs as well as logistics parks planned to target more ecommerce, retail and omnichannel occupiers. The South, especially Long An and Dong Nai has huge potential for investment in intermodal or multi- modal transportation terminals, especially utilizing lower cost modes such as barges to link bulk supply chains competitively to manufacturing processing and distribution processes from and to Ba Ria - Vung Tau, up Tay Ninh border gate and down to Can Tho. In the North, significant investments from Multinational Corporations",

Other locations, such as Bac Giang, Vinh Phuc and Hung Yen Provinces have also seen increased demand. Hung Yen boasts of several advantages such as proximity to Hanoi, accessibility to key manufacturing clusters and developed infrastructure, such as National Road 5B which links Hanoi to Hai Phong, as well as available land and lower costs.

Key intersections along routes and the border gates with China will become key logistics nodes once the tier-1 areas mature. There are plans to develop two large Inland Container Depots (“ICDs”) in the west of Hanoi in Duc Thuong District (Hanoi) and in Son Loi District (Vinh Phuc Province), along the Hanoi-Lao Cai Border Gate highway. The current shortage of available warehouse space still presents ample opportunities for logistics development at more attractive rental rates, thereby attracting more investments to the north. This report describes the respective warehouse markets in Bac Ninh and Binh Duong. BAC NINH Economy Bac Ninh’s economy expanded rapidly during 2015 – 2018 driven by investments from large manufacturing companies. However, it experienced a considerable decline in gross regional domestic product (“GRDP”) growth in 2019 to only 1.1% due to weak phone and accessories production, particularly from Samsung Electronics and Samsung Display.

(See Exhibit 1) Despite sluggish growth in recent years, Bac Ninh remains one of the largest industrial hubs of Vietnam and among the leading investment destinations in the North. Due to sustained inflows of FDI, development of domestic enterprises, improvement of business environment as well as rising labor productivity, the outlook for the provincial economy is expected to remain positive. FDI is considered the main driver of economic development in Bac Ninh. A favorable geographical position, abundant labor force, good infrastructure for production (15 industrial parks in the province) and support from government policies have made the province an attractive investment destination for foreign investors. In 2020, the province attracted total registered capital of US$901.2 million, down 43% year-on- year (“YoY”) mainly due to the impact from the pandemic and ranked 8th nationwide. As of December 2020, Bac Ninh’s total FDI capital of effective projects to date is ranked 7th amongst 63 provinces/ cities nationwide. (See Exhibit 2) Bac Ninh is one of the most attractive provinces for investment, ranked 4th in the Provincial Competitiveness Index (“PCI”) 2019 with a total score of 70.79/100 with notable improvements in land access, transparency, time requirement, informal costs, fair competition, business support services and legal procedures.

Nearly 96% of the province’s cumulative registered FDI capital as of 2020 came from manufacturing, which drives demand for industrial and warehouse space. Consequently, Bac Ninh has seen a growing presence of big 3PLs such as LogisValley, DB Schenker, DHL, Linfox, FM Logistics, ALS and Maersk. Many Korean and Japanese 3PLs have also followed MNCs like Samsung, Canon and Foxconn to set up operations in the province. Currently, warehouse supply in Bac Ninh has exceeded 570,000 sq.m, accounting for more than half of the nearly one million sq.m warehouse space in the northern key region. There was hardly any growth in new supply during 2020 as projects scheduled for completion in 2020- 2021 were delayed due to the pandemic. Only FM Logistics moved to their own distribution centre (“DC”) phase 1 of 23,000 sq.m. The most popular districts for logistics are Tu Son for distribution, Yen Phong for consolidation and more recently Thuan Thanh along National Road 17, which is close to Hanoi, Hung Yen and Hai Duong and offers more competitive land costs. The asking gross rent of available newly built Grade A warehouse in Bac Ninh is on average US$4.00/sq.m/ month or within a range of US$3.50/ sq.m/month to US$6.00/sq.m/month.

Large investments in infrastructure and the development of industrial parks are expected to improve the province’s business environment. High-tech, environmentally friendly, high value- added industries i.e. electronics, information and communication, new materials production, automation equipment and biotechnology, will become key industries thanks to the province’s investment incentives. Therefore, warehouse demand in Bac Ninh is expected to keep pace with supply despite the considerable pipeline of new supply. For example, LogisValley Phase 1 & 2 (completed in 2018) have achieved full occupancy while Phase 3 (expected to complete in 2022) is estimated to be 20% pre-committed. On average, quality warehouses are able to achieve full occupancy within 3 to 6 months after completion. Occupancy rates are expected to remain healthy while rentals are expected to increase steadily due to the increasing presence of reputable developers and sustained demand.

Despite the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Binh Duong managed to sustain relatively stable economic growth in 2020, outperforming most other cities/ provinces due to strong industrial development. Binh Duong’s GRDP grew by 6.8% in 2020, lower than the 7.0% - 9.5% achieved from 2011 – 2019 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Industrial and construction continued to be the leading sectors accounting for approximately 66% of total GRDP with IIP growing by 8.0% in 2020.

Despite disruptions caused by the pandemic in 2020, the province attracted total registered capital of US$1.9 billion with 133 newly FDI projects, down 45% YoY mainly due to the Covid-19 pandemic but still among the top 5 destinations in attracting foreign investments. As of 2020, the province ranked 3rd nationwide with 3,932 effective projects with a total investment capital of US$35.5 billion, after Hanoi and HCMC.

Over the last 10 years, warehouse supply has increased by 7% per annum on average and from now to 2022, it is expected to reach 10% per annum due to its established infrastructure and strategic location. With its proximity to HCMC, there is a strong demand for warehouse space to support ecommerce and foreign/ local retailers. Despite disruptions caused by the pandemic in 2020, export growth is expected to be positive in 2021, which provides further impetus for warehousing to serve inbound/outbound goods and consolidation for manufacturing. Most manufacturing sites are now fully occupied and earmarked for expansion while warehousing requirements are outsourced. Despite a large addition of supply in the last three years, the overall occupancy rate of warehouses in Binh Duong has remained at a healthy level of 94%, indicating sustained market demand in this region.
