Market Price Development The medium and long-term expectation remains that the demand for cold storage capacity in Vietnam will continue to grow significantly in years to come. The management of ACS expect that in 2024, the market will turn back to growth and the cold storage capacity in general will be utilized and the prices consequently will gradually return to the pre-Covid levels. Experienced a decline in its overall export in 2023 due to external market factors reducing consumers purchasing power and shift in consumption in the US and Europe and other key export markets. The logistic sector has been impacted by this with temporarily lower demand and lower capacity utilization of up to 40% followed by fierce price competition and similarly lower prices for storage services. This has impacted Vietnam’s export and led to temporary reduction of activity in its export manufacturing sector. As a consequence, Vietnamese consumer incomes have fallen slightly with lower consumer demand for imported food among other products. Lower demand for imported foods Global recession Impact on logistics sector Lower demand for cold storage space Price has been low in 2023 due to global recession… …However the",
    "25": "market will turn back in the coming years The cold storage sector has followed this general trend with about the same temporary drop in demand and relatively low capacity utilisation and price reductions. Cold Storage Price Projection  From 2019 to 2023, the pricing experienced a decline due to the lower market demand during Covid pandemic and economic crisis.  However, with the growing demand for imported food and the limited supply due to the extended construction period of new cold storage facilities (construction takes 2-3 years for a medium-sized facility), it is anticipated that the market price will experience an upward trend in the coming years.  As the demand gradually rises and the construction of new warehouses lags behind, it is anticipated that the price will start to pick up from 2025.  The price growth is expected to stabilize from 2027 onward at the annual growth of 3%, as the supply of cold storage facilities will catch up with the growing demand.

However, at high level of occupancy (from 85-90% of total installed capacity), electricity consumption is expected to be 10% lower than current amount due to the decrease of empty space to be cooled. • Company monitor energy consumption over the day by turning off all compressors during the peak hours of electricity and use fans to circulate the air in the cold storage.
