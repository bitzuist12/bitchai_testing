Development Growth Investment 4 Cold chain, unlocked: The cold storage opportunity in Asia Pacific Contents → What is cold storage? Cold storage facilities are a vital component of the entire cold chain process. Simply, these facilities are where temperature-sensitive goods are stored before they are transported along the cold chain journey to the final destination, which is usually the end consumer. Through this cold chain process, products are transported and stored in a consistent and temperature-controlled environment, of which cold storage real estate plays a critical role.

Taking ice cream as an example product in the cold chain journey, the recommended storage temperature for ice cream is -27°C or below1, but fluctuations in storage freezer temperatures can lead to textural defects. This typically occurs when the product warms during the transition between freezers. Prolonged warming can result in the loss of air and settling of sugar syrup, causing ice crystals to grow and altering the texture of the product. 1. Australian Alliance",
