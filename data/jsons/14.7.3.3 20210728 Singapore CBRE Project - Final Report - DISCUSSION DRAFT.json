Taken together, the countries in Southeast Asia represented the fifth largest economy in the world with $3.2 trillion GDP in 2019, and are expected to be the fourth largest by 2030 with $10 trillion GDP. The regional consumer market of 650 million people is larger than those in either the EU or North America.

The total leasable warehouse area in Singapore that is dedicated only to cold storage, or where cold storage capacity is available in mixed temperature zone warehouses, currently totals 500,000 square meters.

Capital required to develop the site is in-line with institutional investor appetites. Sets a new benchmark for cold chain that is NOT reliant on having an anchor – positioned as an enabler that changes the cost structure for the entire industry. On this basis the EMP Belstar site can fix a much larger issue than just 'commercial additionality' by reducing the overall operations cost base for the industry. EMP Belstar will need to demonstrate 'commercial additionality' to receive the relevant JTC site approvals. Obvious benefit to show sustainability credentials to attract large clients where ESG is a major decision-making factor (attract HAVI or MB who serve McD’s) Schneider Electric – play on developers who don’t follow-through on carbon reduction commitments. Establish that there is minimal cannibalization i.e. prove there is a problem with the high cost of inefficient cold storage in Singapore.
