        "text": "administered between January and May 2020 by the GCCA staff. In addition, an official government report was a source for part of the information on the United States (U.S. Department of Agriculture). Summary of the Findings The total capacity of refrigerated warehouses worldwide was 719 million cubic meters in 2020, 16.7% greater than the capacity reported in 2018. The increase in reported capacity since 2018 was largely from North America and China. The United States, at 156 million cubic meters, was the single largest country market, followed by India at 150 million cubic meters and China at 131 million cubic meters. Refrigerated warehouse space was distributed unevenly across countries based on the index of market penetration developed by the Global Cold Chain Alliance (GCCA). The market development index is calculated as cold storage capacity per urban resident. The worldwide average in 2020 was 0.15, with a range from 0.9 to less than 0.1 cubic meters per resident. The urban population is used in this benchmark because it is expected that those with middle-class income concentrate in these areas. In developing country markets, the middle-class and high-income consumer segments support the demand for refrigerated and frozen foods, which ultimately drives the refrigerated warehouse service industry. Refrigerated warehouses serve various needs in the food logistics process: storage of seasonally produced foods to allow them to be available year-round, short-term storage staged in strategic locations to meet retail distribution needs, and import-export logistics service facilities along global transportation routes. There are two classifications of business models: warehouses available to multiple users on a for-hire basis and those operated by a food company exclusively for that company\u2019s use. In this report as in industry practice, the warehouses available for-hire are referred to the third-party logistics business model (3PLs). The refrigerated warehouses operated by a"

Certain limitations should be noted due to defining the scope of the industry and variations in units of measure. Scope of the industry as a limitation on the data. The intent of this study is to provide information on all refrigerated warehouse space in a country, regardless of ownership and business model (3PL or private). Because the Global Cold Chain Alliance is a trade association of 3PLs and has information sources largely in the 3PL industry, it is possible that warehouses that were operated privately may not have been thoroughly covered by the information sources affiliated with the GCCA. The experts' estimates and inclusion or exclusion of privately operated space explains the discontinuity in capacity across years in certain countries. For example, in 2020, a significant part of the growth in capacity for Canada was because information on privately operated refrigerated warehouse space was included for the first time. Units of measure. There is potential for error in the statistics in this report because conversion factors between quantity units must be applied. Most of the survey respondents provide information in cubic meters, which is the standard capacity unit adopted by the Global Cold Chain Alliance. Therefore, most of the units of measure are consistent throughout the report. However, a few nations customarily report in pallets, which presents a complication because the size of a standard pallet differs for European and American markets. (Please see the Appendix for the conversion factors applied). Some responses were received in metric tonnage units. Tonnage units were converted to cubic meters on the basis of an assumption provided"

Together, these countries comprised 61% of the refrigerated warehouse space worldwide. In the United States and China, capacity expanded rapidly. Capacity in India was reported to be stable. We also saw increases in capacity across a number of European countries due to inclusion of additional data provided by Rabobank.

Variation in Refrigerated Capacity Across Countries Countries with larger population, consumer income, and geographic area likely have differing needs for refrigerated warehousing services. To facilitate comparisons across countries, a market development index was calculated. This metric is defined as cubic meters per population in the urban areas. The global average for the market development index was 0.152 in 2020. As expected, many of the higher-income countries had greater presence of refrigerated warehousing capacity relative to the urban population. Per-capita market penetration in the better-served markets ranged from 0.94 cubic meters to 0.3 cubic meters per urban resident (Figure 2). The highest market index levels were in Netherlands (0.94) and Canada (0.90). Portugal, New Zealand, Spain, Great Britain, and the United States ranged from 0.58 to 0.74 cubic meters of refrigerated warehouse space per urban resident. 4 Among the emerging market economies, India reported the highest level of market penetration with 0.33, which is nearly the same market development level since 2016. India\u2019s population is less urbanized than in China, Brazil, and other emerging market economies, so the index is likely over-stating the adequacy of refrigerated warehousing in India relative to countries at similar national income levels. The countries in the middle ranks in terms of refrigerated"

While the growth rate appears significant over the last two years (since the last Global Capacity Report), when the U.S. capacity trend is smoothed over a 10-year period, the rate of growth was 3.8% annually since 2010 (compound annual growth rate 2010-2020). The estimated capacity of refrigerated warehouses in the USA is largely based on membership records of the Global Cold Chain Alliance (GCCA) and its contact information on warehouses that are operated as third- party for hire refrigerated warehouses. GCCA does not have an estimate for the privately-operated warehouses and therefore a U.S. Department of Agriculture survey is used as a source of information on warehouses that are privately-operated. According to our best estimates, more than 80% of U.S. refrigerated storage capacity is third-party for hire (Figure 5).

The three largest country markets\u2014the United States, India, and China--accounted for 60.8% of the global total of refrigerated space. Note that a portion of this growth is due to reporting from new countries as well as improvements in data collection. Total refrigerated warehouse capacity was compared with urban population to obtain a market development index that sheds light on the extent of unmet needs in a particular country. Variation in the market development index across countries was significant, as a result of differences in consumers\u2019 buying power in the countries as well as differences in food production and trading patterns. Based on the findings for 2020, Mexico, Brazil, and China had the largest unmet need for refrigerated warehouse space. Beyond continued increased demand based on consumer\u2019s buying power, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused various disruptions in the food supply chain highlighting the critical role for cold storage capacity. Despite challenges, now more than ever, cold chain capacity and logistics will play a critical role in ensuring that safe, high quality food reaches all consumers. 12 References Euromonitor International: Urban Population, Total Population.

The units, which cost a total of VND500 billion ($21.7 million), will be installed with modern technology imported from the EU. The first one is expected to welcome goods from the third quarter of 2023. The construction of the remaining storage in the centre will be slated for 2027, with an average construction speed of 1-2 units per year.

The cold chain industry plays an important role in reducing the wastage of perishable products and commodities. The user industrial sectors such as livestock, fisheries, processed food and chemical, pharmaceutical and drug industries play an important part for national development. This can be seen from its contribution to Indonesia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). Food and beverage industry is one of the prioritized manufacturing sectors that can support Indonesia\u2019s economic recovery and structural transformation post Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021, the sector contributed 6% of Indonesia\u2019s national Gross Domestic Product and 20% of total exports to a value of US$ 45.4 billion. The sector is dominated by micro- and small- medium enterprises and employs an aggregate of 4.6 million people, providing livelihood for many.

Investment picked up, exports boomed, inflation was low, and the budget deficit was lower than forecast. Key reforms were implemented last year, and stronger growth is expected for 2022. The downside risks are the economic impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and potential COVID-19 outbreaks are still of concern. The medium-term challenge is to harness digitalization to raise productivity and growth. Indonesian cold chain relativity The current National Logistics Capacity for all materials is 31,000,000 Tons. * (latest numbers) Of which cold chain sector is 1,920,000 tons. Majority of Cold Chain operations companies are registered in ARPI the Asosiasi Rantai Pendingin Indonesia (Indonesian Cold Chain Association) and ALFI the Asosiasi Logistics Freight Forwarders Indonesia. This includes Pharmaceuticals, F&B Industries, Fresh Food products, Fish & Seafood, Dairy & Ice Cream. Capacity as of October 2020 was 2.4mm Pallets @ 750-1,000kg per pallet.

This is also a requirement for export and import business of fishery products, meat, fruit and vegetables and the ice cream industry. An example of a major protein producer is shown below. October 2022 4 Indonesian cold chain players Based on a survey conducted by CIC, at the end of 2018, there were around 69 major cold storage companies throughout Indonesia with a total capacity of 370,000 tons per year. The number one Company being PT Enseval Putera Megatrading Tbk (EPMT), which is responsible for delivering pharmaceuticals for Kalbe and third-party principal products to over 1 million outlets in Indonesia. In addition, Kalbe has also expanded the business portfolio of the Division to include raw material trading, medical device trading and retail and health services. Kalbe\u2019s distribution and Logistic network for pharmaceuticals products is the most extensive in Indonesia. The table below shows the top 10 companies. To maintain a cold storage facility requires a substantial investment, and it\u2019s not surprising that many companies do not have their own cold storage facilities. Rather, many of them rent or cooperate with cold storage owners. This makes it is very difficult to know the exact amount of cold storage operation in Indonesia.

Cold Storage services include refrigerators, chilled rooms, thawing rooms, freezer rooms, blast chillers and blast freezers. Greater Jakarta has more than 40 cold chain companies with major location of cold storage being North Jakarta, West Jakarta, and Bekasi. The basic storage types can be divided simply into Industrial and Commercial. Commercial sites are for business activities such as logistics and supply chain management hubs and generally have the capacity of below 500 tons, these units are generally leased or rented. The industrial storage facilities have more than 500 tons capacity and function usually as a part of production facility. However, there is a growing trend of new build cold storage warehouses. One of the noted changes evident post the pandemic is that Cold Chain and refrigerated Cold storage always used to be pallet in and pallet out. Now, like many sectors, refrigerated is transitioning to pallet in and case out or pallet in and singles out. This is largely driven by Ecommerce and cold chain players recognizing that the increase of more B2C (Business to Consumer) & D2C (Direct to Consumer). Which in turn will require more, smaller, storage spaces, usually for fulfilment purposes. Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world and the second largest producer of seafood.

These risks only double when it comes to medications and pharmaceutical goods, which the Covid-19 pandemic further highlighted through the transportation of temperature-sensitive vaccines. Temperature sensitive products also need to be monitored each step of the supply chain link with data tracking technology to ensure their viability for end-use. Any break in protocol will result in the loss of the product due to spoiled ingredients that must be transported at set temperatures.

October 2022 10 Foodservice cold chain Demand drivers of growth The Grocery market is a key driver of Cold Chain Logistics, as cold storage reduces food losses during transport & storage. Growing affluence of consumers has led to increased demand for fresh products causing supermarkets and their suppliers to increase capacity of cold chain logistics. Cold storage logistics is a sector that has gained traction in recent months due to the growing opportunities for drug and vaccine imports and exports, coupled with the spike for online retail and food delivery services. October 2022 11 Prospects look good Over the medium to long term, increasing affluence of the middle class in the region, fueled by rapid economic development will also underpin the strong pace of growth of the cold chain market. According to Ernst & Young, Asia Pacific\u2019s middle class will amount to 3.3 billion in 2030 or two-thirds of the global middle class, up from just one-third in 2009. The outlook for the cold storage logistics sector is bright as its fundamentals have been upgraded given the consumer behavioral changes for grocery shopping and surge in demand for biopharmaceuticals. 62 818150373 Service Offerings \u2022 Supply Chain Operational Health Checks \u2022 White paper preparation on industry specific topics \u2022 Safety Obsessed Health & Safety Reviews"

The report also comes at a time when an increasing understanding of the global value chains that are the key drivers for the flow of trade in both goods and services is impacting the way that industries and government view trade in terms of investment and policy development. As a business function of distribution services, cold chain services are force multipliers that create a world of opportunities for related trade and exports of goods. A cold chain can most readily be defined as a series of warehousing and distribution activities that is designed to ensure ideal storage and transportation conditions for temperature-sensitive products. Cold chain services also have the added benefit of improving quality of life for billions of people around the world and are in high demand, especially in less developed economies that suffer from malnutrition, high rates of food spoilage and chronic disease. This year\u2019s report uses World Economic Forum research as well as industry insight to assess 20 international markets for cold chain expansion. The case studies section of the report covers 11 countries that collectively represent more than $450 billion out of more than $1.8 trillion in total sales by U.S. majority owned foreign affiliates in distribution services. The countries also represent more than $800 billion in total U.S. goods and services exports.

In consumer markets, cold chains provide access to products previously unavailable locally, raising the quality of life through fresher, safer food, pharmaceuticals and biologics while increasing opportunities for retail and franchise sales growth. The biggest barriers to cold chain growth remain government protectionist measures and non-tariff barriers, often in related distribution services industries. The difficulties and delays of clearing customs or transporting products across borders is also a major impediment for services. Through policy development, commercial dialogues, participation in trade negotiations and managing Industry Advisory Committees, including the Advisory Committee on Supply Chain Competitiveness, the International Trade Administration (ITA) has been focused on reducing these barriers to trade and will continue to work with countries around the world to provide opportunities for distribution service providers to compete on a level playing field. 2016 ITA Cold Chain Top Markets Report | 4 This Page Intentionally Left Blank 2016 ITA Cold Chain Top Markets Report | 5 Figure 1: Projected Cold Chain Export Markets (Bold indicates case studies included in report) 1.

Cold chain systems are crucial to the growth of global trade in perishable products and to the worldwide availability of food and health supplies. Each year, billions of tons of fresh food products and millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. exports are lost due to poor cold chain systems in developing markets. The World Economic Forum lists food crises as fourth on its top global risks of highest concern for the next 10 years.1 Globally, billions of dollars are spent on improving agricultural processes to create higher food yields, but the fact that nearly half of all food never makes it to a consumer\u2019s plate is largely ignored.2 Global losses in the food industry total more than $750 billion annually.3 These losses primarily result from lack of proper facilities, improper food safety handling procedures and insufficient training for those personnel working in the cold chain. Additionally, over $260 billion of annual biopharma sales are dependent on cold chain logistics to ensure the efficacy of their products.4 The concept and technology for controlling the temperature of sensitive products has been well- established for decades. The development of cold chain systems, especially in terms of government policy, however, is a fairly new concept.

Industry Overview and Competitiveness The series of warehousing and distribution activities that comprise a cold chain system are designed to ensure ideal storage and transportation conditions for temperature-sensitive products. Dozens of U.S. export industries depend on the vital links that cold chain systems provide. U.S. businesses invest hundreds of millions of dollars in their cold chain operations to create efficiency and reliability because an end-to-end cold chain is only as efficient and secure as the weakest link in the system. Each link in the cold chain must maintain the same level of integrity for the customer to receive a satisfactory product. A single breakdown in the chain can result in catastrophic losses of product. Cold chain services that support perishable food distribution globally are estimated to be valued at nearly $250 billion.7 Experts also estimate that cold chain logistics spending in support of biopharma industry is more than $10 billion and is expected to grow to $13 billion by 2019. Asia alone contributes to $1.2 billion in growth.8 The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of cold chain markets is anticipated to reach nearly 16 percent into 2019.9 The United States is a world leader in developing the technology and processes necessary to develop and manage cold chain systems efficiently; therefore, the U.S. is well positioned to capture a large share of the global market for cold chain development. According to the Global Cold Chain Alliance, an industry association comprised of the many industries that make up cold chain services, global refrigerated warehouse capacity"

While the majority of cold chain services are utilized in the fresh food market, cold chain operators typically transport and distribute both processed and fresh foods, especially in the U.S. Fresh foods, like fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry and dairy, require an uninterrupted cold chain due to their perishable nature. By controlling parameters of temperature, humidity and atmospheric composition, along with utilizing proper handling procedures, cold chain service providers can increase the product life of fresh foods for days, weeks or even months. These services allow fresh products to hold their value longer, increasing their transportability and providing opportunities that expand their market reach. Cold chain systems for processed foods have a slightly different flow. The activities involved in processing are usually transformative in nature and involve adding ingredients or preservatives or altering the natural characteristics of the food product. These alterations can extend the life of the resulting product by months 2016 ITA Cold Chain Top Markets Report | 8 or even years. In some cases, processing may delink the product from the cold chain system if the resulting product is no longer susceptible to temperature shifts. The nature of processing also allows the use of lower grade food products that are not suitable quality for the fresh food market. Thus, processing can be considered as an option to maximize food harvesting and to optimize the utilization of available cold chains and various grades of harvested food. The exact structure of each cold chain varies significantly depending on product and customer requirements; however,"

A complete cold chain system may include post-harvest pre-cooling or freezing, processing, temperature controlled warehouse or storage, retail or distribution and refrigerated transport between locations. Requirements for cold chain facilities vary based on the size, type and amount of product, along with the particular requirements of the customer. Fruits and vegetables often require cool facilities and are stored around 55\u00b0F. Most dairy products require temperatures just above freezing around 35\u00b0F. Meat and poultry products are typically stored just below freezing at approximately 28\u00b0F. Ice cream and other frozen products may require deep freezing at temperatures that can range from -10\u00b0F to -150\u00b0F. The Global Cold Chain Alliance (GCCA), through its core partner, the World Food Logistics Organization (WFLO), maintains information and research on the safe harvesting, storage, handling and transporting of different commodities and temperature-sensitive products. ITA has a strong partnership with GCCA to help expand and grow cold chain systems around the world based on international best practices. Each cold chain varies by region, location and temperature requirements; however, ensuring a cold chain for agricultural products begins at the farm. Produce often goes through precooling at the harvest location and is then loaded onto a truck or other transportation unit designed to keep the produce protected from the sun and held within a desirable temperature range, as it travels to a processor facility or a temperature controlled warehouse. In less- developed locations, transportation may be carried out on covered trucks or smaller carts; in more developed locations, these transportation solutions can include insulated reefer trucks.

This is especially true for small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) attempting to expand into international markets. Transportation costs are often the most challenging obstacles to suppliers in developing countries.13 In countries with well-developed cold chains, most retail and franchise service providers outsource their supply chain operations to third party logistics providers (3PLs) and to other cold chain service providers that meet their requirements based on their products and business strategies. A recent global trend in cold chain is the rise of E- commerce for fresh food and grocery sales, as well as prepared food delivery. In the U.S. and China, there are a growing number of delivery services that offer fast food and dining beyond the traditional pizza delivery experience. A third party, rather than a vertically integrated part of a retail franchise, often provides these services to the restaurant operator or directly to the consumer, much like a 3PL would offer delivery and transportation for products. Grocery delivery, including fresh and frozen foods, is a rapidly growing service that is being utilized around the world.

From 2008 to 2012, sales by logistics services affiliates rose on average 21 percent, suggesting that cold chain and logistics service providers are responding to an international demand for value-added services.16 Global Industry Landscape In the United States, cold chain systems are well- developed through many years of investment and provide high quality of life benefits to U.S. consumers. In fact, in 2008, the World Health Organization attributed refrigeration as a major factor in the reduction of stomach cancer by nearly 90 percent in the United States since 1930.17 Cold chains in the United States are designed to meet high demands from businesses, consumers and regulators. Businesses require products that meet the level of quality of their business structure; consumers demand the highest quality available based on the price they are willing to pay; and regulators, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), set requirements and minimum safety standards for the handling of many consumer foods and temperature-sensitive products.

The United States imports more than 5 billion fresh cut flowers each year. Exports of temperature-sensitive products from the U.S. to many of these same sourcing countries are still limited, however, due to inadequate distribution cold chains outside of the United States. Improving technologies in cold transportation has created a shift in transporat modes; flowers are increasingly being transported to the U.S. via ocean going vessels, rather than the traditional, more expensive air transportation option. In fact, global shipments of all perishable products by ocean carriers has increased rapidly over the last 35 years.18 Reasons for the shift include greater availability of refrigerated containers, improved facilites at ports and better technology options for monitoring shipments in route.19 Air transporation is still a heavily relied on mode of cold transportation for many high value items, such as biologics and bioengineered drugs which can cost as much as $100,000 or more. The amount of biotechnology products that require cold chain has risen drastically around the world. Nearly half of the top 50 global drug products in 2013 required cold chain services. These drug sales amounted to $104 billion, and the overall cold chain biopharma industry is expected to grow to $350 billion by 2019.20 Cargo challenges in air transportation have led to some pharmaceuticals shifting to sea modes in recent years.

Challenges and Barriers While it can be challenging to operate a business in any international environment, one of the greatest challenges to cold chain expansion in a developing market is the lack of infrastructure necessary to sustain cold chains. Transportation systems in many of these economies can make reliably transporting refrigerated products in a timely manner difficult to near impossible. In addition, lack of reliable power for cold warehouses, power hookups for reefer trailers at ports and transportation hubs, and adequate facilities at the final customer locations add further costs and complications. Over many years numerous aid agencies and organizations, both government and private, have been driven by the humanitarian benefits of cold chain to address many of these infrastructure issues in markets that suffer from massive food wastage and malnutrition, with varying degrees of success. Ultimately however, many of these groups fail to reach their goals of widespread cold chain development, largely because they view cold chain as an industry of its own rather than a business function of a global value chain. Thus, they fail to address the second and perhaps most pertinent challenge to the growth of cold chain: finding ways to make a reasonable return on investment.

Due to the enormous investment costs, cold chain operators need a significant amount of volume to become profitable within an ideal time frame of 2-3 years. These volumes typically are met predominantly through large, organized retailers and franchises. For these reasons, the growth of cold chain services often coincides with the growth of the international retail and franchise markets. It is ultimately the retailers and the branded marketers that control the production and flow of products through cold chains to the consumers. By their nature, most services, like retailers, provide sales to foreign countries that require a physical presence in that country. Service providers therefore establish branches or foreign affiliates to provide these international services. It is critical that, in order for services in a country to grow, there must be in place business friendly government policies that are open to foreign direct investment (FDI). Protectionist measures by foreign governments, often seen in lower and middle-income economies, tend to restrict foreign services activities, especially in the area of distribution services like retail. In doing so, these economies inadvertently restrict the opportunities to expand and grow the business function of cold chain services. While the prime markets for cold chain are often consumer driven, developed economies and, in some cases, emerging economies can pose opportunities for cold chain operators to service exports that are primarily headed to foreign consumer markets. These prime developing markets need to have policies"

In developing, lower income markets, the most likely initial opportunities include design and engineering of warehouses, the operation of third party logistics and technologies that can efficiently overcome shortfalls in infrastructure development, for example: developing economies with unreliable electricity may require unique solutions or alternative energy sources to properly maintain warehouse temperature; a lack of adequate roads may also mean new transportation options or versatile refrigerated containers need to be developed. As these solutions are developed and introduced, they provide new access to international markets and opportunities for small businesses and farmers where previously there were none. The highest quality products from these small farms are mostly exported to other regions since consumers are often unable or unwilling to pay for the higher quality products locally, and without economies of scale, local retailers are unable to support the investments necessary to maintain the quality of products. The economic activity sparked by these international transactions increases the income of engaged locals and spurs investment by international retailers and franchisors. As the economy develops into a higher income consumer market and the retail industry becomes more organized, cold chain services will shift more product from exports to the retail and franchises that begin to operate locally. In many of these developing economies, smaller \u201cmom and pop\u201d retail establishments can often be the greatest recipients of benefits from this situation, since these local establishments are often able to utilize economies of scale from the same supply chains as the large companies without the large footprint.

The country has shown overall improvement in every category of the Index since 2007, though the category of Customs has slightly declined since 2012 to the rank of 38,th due largely to the cumbersome process and significant amounts of paperwork.70 A lack of knowledge of internationally recognized best practices, clear concise regulations and enforcement in transportation and cold chain logistics means smaller logistics providers in China often cut corners to save costs. This has led to inconsistencies in quality and mistrust between businesses and consumers and acts as a barrier for any company entering the market that utilizes proper practices and equipment.71 Lack of trained labor specific to the logistics industry has made business expansion difficult for many U.S. companies. APICS (formerly the American Society of Transportation and Logistics) has developed training and certification in logistics management and is working on similar programs for the cold chain industry in China. While China seems to have no shortage of available labor, the struggle of logistics companies to reduce costs often means lower levels of training for employees. Cold chain operators may find a limited amount of trained labor available for operations and should, therefore, anticipate providing extensive amounts of training for all aspects of logistics and cold chain operation.

These farms have neither the means nor incentive to invest in cold storage and lack the knowledge or capacity to apply proper packaging or handling techniques. Furthermore, a lack of access to adequate transportation infrastructure virtually cuts these farmers off from all but the most local, informal consumer markets. Many agriculture products can be seen transported along motorways in wheelbarrows or on motorbikes, oxcarts or small vehicles, and many markets are supplied by pushcart.

More than 80 percent of the local food market in Kenya is informal, and these products suffer from a fundamental lack of understanding or consumer demand for best practices in handling and transportation. Rural distribution for food products is often based on informal networks where firms, such as Coca-Cola and Unilever, employ locals to take goods to consumers. While these distribution networks are somewhat functional, they are often not efficient. Exporters that can make large investments in distribution networks to supply the mass market may therefore develop a competitive advantage.118 Approximately 18 percent of households in Kenya are connected to a power grid, and the lack of access to electricity makes building a cold storage facility outside of the main metropolitan zones very difficult.

Wet markets still represent a major point of sale for fresh grocery products. Wet markets are reminiscent of traditional markets and serve as destinations that sell fresh produce, meat and fish products. Older consumers tend to prefer shopping in these outlets.

U.S. country and industry experts are on site at IBP shows to provide hands-on export counseling, market analysis and matchmaking services. Each IBP show also has an International Business Center, where U.S. companies can meet privately with prospective international buyers, prospective sales representatives and business partners and obtain assistance from experienced ITA staff. 2016 ITA Cold Chain Top Markets Report | 62 The Advocacy Center http://www.export.gov/advocacy/ The Advocacy Center coordinates U.S. government interagency advocacy efforts on behalf of U.S. exporters bidding on public-sector contracts with overseas governments and government agencies. The Advocacy Center helps to ensure that sales of U.S. products and services have the best possible chance competing abroad. Advocacy assistance is wide and varied but often involves companies that want the U.S. government to communicate a message to foreign governments or government- owned corporations on behalf of their commercial interest, typically in a competitive bid contest. U.S. Commercial Service http://www.export.gov/usoffices/index.asp With offices throughout the United States and in U.S. Embassies and consulates in nearly 80 countries, the U.S. Commercial Service utilizes its global network of trade professionals to connect U.S. companies with international buyers worldwide. Whether looking to make their first export sale or expand to additional international markets, companies will find the expertise they need to tap into lucrative opportunities and increase their bottom line. This includes trade counseling, actionable market intelligence, business matchmaking, and commercial diplomacy. 2016 ITA Cold Chain Top Markets Report | 63 Appendix 1: Methodology Key Market Assessment Requirements U.S. businesses engaged in international cold chain activity assess markets against specific criteria when selecting locations for expansion.

Government/Regulatory The first aspect that U.S. industries consider when looking at a new market is the regulatory environment of the country. In particular, U.S. industry looks for a stable government with transparent policymaking plus technical regulations, standards and procedures for assessment of conformity that are non-discriminatory and based on relevant, internationally recognized best practices. Legal frameworks that allow companies to resolve legal disputes and challenge regulations are essential when identifying potential export markets. Labor Force Another important aspect for market decision-making is the quality and skill level of the potential work force in the market. Industry must have the capacity to train and develop the talent and the management required to run an efficient supply chain operation. Infrastructure The infrastructure within a country is another key aspect in a company\u2019s selection of export markets. Electricity and IT infrastructure must be sufficient to support logistics operations. Transportation infrastructure must be capable of supporting the reliable distribution of a product within the country or region without excessive delays. The International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses has noted a strong correlation of cold storage capacity to a country\u2019s transportation score in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Transport Index.161 Demand Finally, the demand within a country must be considered. The potential size of the market will depend on consumer needs, the number of consumers in the country, products produced and demanded by the market as well as the level of development within the market. Methodology When determining which global markets policy-makers should target for export promotion and trade policy activities, it is important to account for the primary decision-making criteria of U.S. businesses engaged in the cold chain market.

These are reflected in the report\u2019s scorecard and country case studies. The scorecard for this report is derived from the Global Competitiveness Index 2015-2016 created by the World Economic Forum for their Global Competitiveness Report.162 By using this competitiveness index, a cross-country analysis based on these market evaluation criteria is possible. Particular aspects of the index were used to represent the primary criteria that industry indicated as a priority in market selection. 2016 ITA Cold Chain Top Markets Report | 64 The scorecard assigns a numeric value to each of the criteria on a scale of 1 to 7, with 7 being the highest score in a particular category. The scorecard is color-coded, using red, yellow and green to indicate comparative values of countries in the same income level. It is important to note that the colors yellow and red do not necessarily represent a poor environment but rather represent the lower 40 percent of scores in the given income level. New for 2016, a separate category has been added to assess industry\u2019s interest in each of the countries. The Global Cold China Alliance, which represents all major industries engaged in temperature-controlled logistics, provided ratings on a scale of 1 to 7, with 7 being the highest score based on their members expressed interest. This industry interest category effectively contributes 20 percent to the total country score. The case studies in this report analyze selected potential markets and assess important competitiveness factors. These case studies are intended to aid ITA in promoting the development of efficient international cold chains to improve U.S. export opportunities. Inclusion or omission of countries in the case study section does not necessarily indicate that these are higher or lower ranked"

Cold storage facilities will increasingly need multiple temperature zones, an expanded number of doors and bays (to facilitate fulfilment), and dedicated areas for services such as packing zones. 2 2 Rising asset creation The global cold storage sector has expanded from 550 million cubic metres in 2014 to an estimated 785 million cubic metres in 2022. Assuming the same growth rate, the market is projected to exceed 1.1 billion cubic metres by 2030. 3 3 Macro and industry demand drivers are strong Global disruptions have emphasised the importance of robust supply chains and the essential role of cold storage real estate. Relatively inelastic demand, changing consumption patterns, and the rise of e-commerce are boosting demand for efficient cold chain logistics. 4 4 Attractive investment factors Investor interest is shifting towards alternative and higher-yielding asset classes. Stable cash flows, higher barriers to entry, technological advancements, longer lease terms, yield premiums, portfolio diversification, and attractive risk-adjusted returns contribute to the attractiveness of the cold storage sector in the current investment landscape. 3 Cold chain, unlocked: The cold storage opportunity in Asia Pacific Contents \u2192 What\u2019s the opportunity?

Growth expectations are robust for these two industries. With online sales growth exceeding offline growth, operators, investors, and developers should target manufacturers and producers that have higher exposure to e-commerce platforms and networks. Investing in cold storage offers resilient and stable returns. With both higher rental rates and yields when compared to traditional logistics and industrial (L&I) real estate, cold storage assets can provide an attractive destination for capital in the current investment climate. Development Growth Investment 4 Cold chain, unlocked: The cold storage opportunity in Asia Pacific Contents \u2192 What is cold storage? Cold storage facilities are a vital component of the entire cold chain process. Simply, these facilities are where temperature-sensitive goods are stored before they are transported along the cold chain journey to the final destination, which is usually the end consumer. Through this cold chain process, products are transported and stored in a consistent and temperature-controlled environment, of which cold storage real estate plays a critical role.

Taking ice cream as an example product in the cold chain journey, the recommended storage temperature for ice cream is -27\u00b0C or below1, but fluctuations in storage freezer temperatures can lead to textural defects. This typically occurs when the product warms during the transition between freezers. Prolonged warming can result in the loss of air and settling of sugar syrup, causing ice crystals to grow and altering the texture of the product. 1. Australian Alliance"

This presents opportunities for differentiation and for developers and investors to become industry leaders in cold storage real estate. For instance, there are real opportunities to leverage advanced technology and sustainable practices in cold storage facilities. Implementing energy-efficient systems, insulation, and renewable energy sources can help reduce environmental impact and operational costs. Additionally, incorporating automation and digital solutions can improve operational efficiency and streamline processes. Further, as the cold storage industry evolves, there is an opportunity to adapt facilities to meet changing logistical requirements.

This reflects a 4.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Assuming this same CAGR, the market will grow to more than 1.1 billion cubic metres by 20302. Despite strong potential growth, this is arguably a conservative estimate. More capacity may be needed given the structural changes in consumption patterns and the shift to online spending. Global disruptions have also highlighted the criticality of the cold chain sector. These factors have and will continue to have long- term demand implications for the amount of cold storage space needed, how they are designed and operated, and where they are located.

Assuming current population projections3 and historical CAGR cold storage capacity growth, global capacity per capita will almost double to 0.13 cubic metres by 2030. Capacity levels differ significantly in APAC. Generally, the more advanced economies have greater capacity relative to more emerging parts of Asia. This is unsurprising given that logistics networks in these countries tend to be more sophisticated and institutionalised. According to the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) 2023, Singapore ranked 1st, Japan came in 13th, while South Korea ranked 17th globally. Australia and China both ranked 19th.

Today, markets are developed, and, except for land desig- nated by the government as rice land, farmers are free to select the crops they wish to grow. Impressive increases in rice production achieved during the last two decades, primarily in the Mekong and Red River deltas, the country\u2019s two rice bowls, have not, however, resolved the problems associated with the large number of small holdings with limited earning potential. But the legacy of the past remains, with the government still prescribing rice national self-suf- ficiency approach as the best way forward and prescribing lands that are only allowed to produce rice. One conse- quence of this approach is that income from specialized rice farming on very small farms (typically 0.1ha in the Red River area) is particularly low and continues to fall further behind that of other segments of the population as the economy grows. Already for many of these farmers rice is a part time occupation and unless the restrictions on diversifying out of rice are eased, the country faces the risk of only the old continuing with rice cultivation. Increasing rice productivity, cropping intensity and farm mechanization could somewhat ameliorate this situation but with yields already at a fairly high levels the scope is limited. The current land policy designating rice areas has costs for farmers and costs for Vietnam. The costs for farmers are mainly linked to lost opportunities to plant and sell higher value crops such as horticulture crops where this is pos- sible. The costs to Vietnam are lost opportunities to export a greater volume of higher value commodities than rice. Looking to the future, improving farm productivity and generating higher"

In addition, farming activities will become more attractive if the government would recast current food security policy and relinquish altogether the prescription prohibiting certain areas from producing anything but rice and allowing farmers to choose their own cropping patterns or at least rotate rice with other crops. This will put the improvement of current land policy at the center of coming government efforts to maintain sec- tor and income growth in agriculture in the coming years. The government will also have to take account of another change that is occurring, which is a change in the Viet- namese diet.

Rice remains of extreme impor- tance, however, for the poor, but urban dwellers, with higher incomes, are already moving to other food sources includ- ing wheat based products and higher protein products, particularly meat and fish. Government policy still gives great importance to rice production over any other crop. Expectations of a decline in the importance of rice in the coming years from the current dominant level will enable more balanced national agricultural policies to be developed in the future. In contrast to the ongoing fall in per capita rice consump- tion, meat demand, particularly beef, is rising rapidly while fish demand shows minor growth.

Presently domestic production of animal feed is already grossly below demand and the requisite imports totaled over $2 Billion in 2011 suggesting that there are opportunities for more local production of feed grain inputs, particularly maize. Pork production has been highly successful and do- mestic production currently supplies 90 percent of demand, though diseases have set back production.2 As the previous discussion indicates, Vietnam is in a very favorable food security position from the perspective of food availability; it produces sufficient quantities of most food items to satisfy local demand though there is a growing deficit of corn used as animal and fish feed. The success of Vietnam\u2019s agricultural sector can be judged by the ability to meet local demand while also exporting large quantities of rice and fish. Various scenarios of future GDP, population, and changing diets indicate that Vietnam will still be able to continue to meet most domestic demands and have surplus production for exports. The main food security issue remain- ing is therefore that of whether people have enough income to purchase their food needs. The more important issue for Vietnam is poverty rather than food availability.

Looking ahead, the proposed shift in land policy mentioned above will encourage the creation of farms of a size big enough to spread costs, increase incomes, and have suf- ficient security of tenure to encourage capital investments by commercial farmers in infrastructure and machinery that will help Vietnam remain competitive in the coming years. However this change in land policy will not be sufficient to safeguard the future of the sector. The country report outlines six additional critical areas where the government should play a key role in the coming years by providing support for market friendly reforms that will facilitate the farmers\u2019 professional activities and suggests the orientation of an action program in each case to remedy each potential problem. In addition to land policy improvement they cover: Support for the development of the post-harvest value chain by private sector investors and managers is inadequate. Compared with regional middle income comparators Viet- nam is still backward in the development of post-harvest facilities by the private sector to increase the value added from domestic and export marketing of agriculture and fishery products. This results in lost opportunities for Viet- nam and reduced marketing opportunities for farmers.

Areas of support could in- clude (1) assistance with fishing boat design and safety; (2) improving and in some instances consolidating value chains, supply channels, disease control and environmental management within the full range of aquaculture options; (3) increase training of workers, restructuring and in some instances relocating fishing villages, strengthening fisher- ies inspection capacity; (4) improving management through co-management options partnering fishers and local com- munities.

As in many other coun- tries, after a number of food safety scares, Vietnam faces a serious problem of consumers\u2019 distrust in the quality of national food products, particularly products of animal origin. Newspapers report concerns over diseases such as SARS, HPAI, PRRS, and residues of pesticides, antibiotics in fruits vegetables and fish. Increased urbanization has increasingly separated the consumer from the production side of the food chain and reduced the possibility for the consumer to understand and verify the production process. This has all combined to increased consumer concern on food safety issues and put at risk several export lines from Vietnam, particularly in the fisheries sector.

The full and timely implementation of the government\u2019s ongoing Land Administration and Management program to upgrade the administration of land management can greatly facilitate this process. \u2022 Border price transmission to farmers. The gov- ernment should make every effort to ensure that prices available to farmers are not unduly distorted by government administrative actions. \u2022 The growing disparity of income between rural and urban workers will result in farmers being more demanding on the profitability of farming, and less able to accept government directed cropping patterns. Over time, government should give farm- ers more freedom to choose their own cropping patterns particularly in those rice designated areas which are amenable to flexible cropping rotations. The Government should start moving away from a centrally planned directed approach to cropping towards a more market based approach. \u2022 The aging of the population, the continuous flight of younger people from the rural areas, and the development of bigger farm sizes should lead to increased mechanization of farming activities to in- crease labor productivity.

ChapTer 1. inTroduCTion In the past thirty years, Vietnam\u2019s agricultural sector has undergone a dramatic change both on the demand and supply side. As per capita income has steadily risen and the incidence of poverty dropped rapidly, the average Vietnam- ese\u2019s diet has undergone a major shift. Rice consumption per capita has declined while the consumption of meats, fish, horticultural products, etc. has risen. On the supply side, Vietnam has gone from a net importer of food in 1980 to a major exporter of rice and fish products. Its average an- nual growth rate of agricultural GDP has been 3.6 percent, a level surpassed only by China, out of the other major agriculture producers. This impressive growth was driven by agriculture TFP growth of 2.3 percent. In addition to enhancing food security, this healthy agricultural growth has led to a sharp reduction in poverty. Activities pertaining to agriculture, livestock and fisheries have been transformed into a more dynamic sector of the economy due to improved productivity arising from the use of advanced technologies, more widespread mecha- nization, and improved quality of production. However the sustainability of past achievements and the continuation of growth are not certain. This report looks more closely at the achievements of the past and the factors affecting food security now and in the future. The report also assesses the critical areas that need attention to ensure continued prog- ress in the sector as Vietnam moves beyond lower middle income status and starts converging towards the national objective of achieving a fully developed economy status.

As a result of this rapid growth, per capita incomes in de- veloping ASEAN have risen impressively from US$1,067 in 1980 to US$2,877 in 2011. In parallel, incidence of abso- lute poverty (incomes below US$1.25 per day) has dropped from around 175 million (42 percent of total population) in the early 1990s to around 80 million (15 percent of total population) in 2011.

Most of the poor live in rural areas. Robust agricultural development is thus not only critical to the food security of the population but key to achieving the goal of inclusive growth.

Under the optimistic sce- nario, developing ASEAN countries would continue to exhibit impressive growth both in GDP and per capita income, while their total population would rise from 593 million to 732 million in 2040. Their combined GDP would total US$9,825 billion (6.4 percent of global GDP), growing at an average annual rate of 6.2 percent. Equally impressive, GDP per capita would rise from US$2,877 to US$13,428, with 87 percent of the population attaining middle class status (per capita income of between $10.80\u2013$100 per day at con- stant 2010 PPP international dollars). After a slow start in the seventies and eighties, Vietnam found a successful policy mix which led to rapid growth. Following a period of centralized planning after the 1976 re- unification of the country, Vietnam introduced a major mar- ket based reform program (\u201cdoi moi\u201d or renovation) at the end of 1986. Of particular relevance to the present study was the decision to let the market set prices for most com- modities and the formalization of land tenure arrangements based on long term \u201ccultivation\u201d rights for family farms by issuing \u201cland use right certificates\u201d to farmers, creating self-managed state owned enterprises and allowing private firms to function and compete openly.

GDP growth, which averaged 6.2 percent in the 1980s, increased at an average rate of 8\u20139 percent per year in the nineties until interrupted for about two years due to the onset of the Asian financial crisis. Growth resumed shortly thereafter, albeit at a more modest rate of 6\u20138 percent in the 2000\u2019s. Economic development during this period was partly driven by strong performance in the agricultural sector where there was a strong growth in food production and agriculture exports. Fisheries and aquacul- ture were strong areas. As described above, Vietnam was also exceptionally successful in rapidly reducing poverty during this period. Social indicators also improved. Agriculture sector growth was good but that in other sectors was even better. The recent history of Vietnam\u2019s economy and the evolution of growth in the key sectors of agriculture, industry and services over the last two decades are clearly shown in the graph by IPSARD in Figure 2.2 showing the contribution of each of these sectors each year from 1990 to 2011 based on GSO data. It can be seen that agricul- ture, consolidated as agriculture forestry and fisheries, has shown steady growth over the years but at a much lower level than the economy as a whole, and much lower than industry, construction and services. The main growth driver of the economy over the years has been industry and con- struction as can be expected. Services have generally"

Until the recent slowdown, Vietnam was one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Be- tween 1980 and 2011, it exhibited average annual growth rate of 6.9 percent. Its total GDP grew eight fold from US$14 billion to US$110 billion during the same period. This growth was driven by Vietnam\u2019s high investment and total factor productivity growth rates. A dynamic agricul- ture sector has fueled growth in rural incomes and made the country a net exporter of agriculture products. At the same time per capita income rose from US$259 per year to US$1,235 and, the poverty rate fell even more dramati- cally as described above. This sharp dramatic reduction in poverty is partly attributed to success in improving agricul- ture productivity and achieving more inclusive growth. And, yet despite the rapid development of the agriculture sector, the agriculture share of GDP has dropped by half in the past twenty years, from 39 percent in 1990 to 21 percent in 2011 as the rest of the economy grew at an even much higher rate.

Prior to the Doi Moi reforms the economy was totally domi- nated by State Owned Enterprises. The Agriculture sector relied on SOE\u2019s for input supply, product marketing and, to the extent it existed, for agroprocessing. Since the introduc- tion of the Doi Moi reforms there has been a consistent rise in the role of the private sector. However the SOE sector still remains an important and influential part of Vietnam\u2019s economy, in competition with the private sector. Now, many SOE\u2019s are increasingly seen as a growing source of inef- ficiency, weak competitiveness, and a constraint to private enterprise development based on their performance.

The optimistic economic growth scenario is based on Vietnam\u2019s historical performance during the last decade, including a brisk investment rate, and a continuing convergence beyond the current middle income status towards a developed in- dustrial economy. Average growth in this scenario would be 7.1% from 2015\u20132040 mirroring the growth performance achieved over the last two decades. Under this optimistic scenario, the model projection showed that by 2040, over 90% of the population would have reached middle class status, bolstering a strong domestic market in addition to the vibrant export market. This scenario assumed a solid evolution of policies including a good national performance in upgrading the efficiency of investment, building up a strong financial sector, successful SOE reform, a strong and dynamic private sector role in the economy, continued social harmony, and buoyant international economic conditions.

ASEAN compared favorably with the global agricultural growth rate (2.4 percent) during 1980\u20132011; however, this growth rate lagged that of China (4.3 percent) and India (3.1 percent). The region\u2019s rich resource endowment (arable land and water) combined with relatively low wage rates have allowed most ASEAN countries to benefit from robust global demand. As the overall GDP growth rate (5.0 percent) was even higher than agriculture, the share of agriculture declined. From 1985\u20132010 this share went from 22 to 12 percent. Presently five out of the eight ASEAN developing countries have a surplus trade balance in agricultural products; the rest are net food importers and must rely on international trade to feed their population. Indonesia enjoys a buoyant and rising overall agricultural trade surplus largely driven by the phenomenally rapid increase in oil palm exports; Viet- nam has gradually increased its exports largely due to rice, fisheries, rubber and coffee; but the Philippines is facing a rising deficit. Rice is an important factor in ASEAN trade. According to the US Department of Agriculture 2012 estimates, the top ten rice exporting countries include four ASEAN members: Thailand (8.0 million tons), Vietnam (7.0 million tons), Cam- bodia (0.95 million tons), and Myanmar (0.75 million tons). By comparison, ASEAN importers in 2010 were: Philippines (2.6 million tons), Malaysia (1.0 million tons), and Indonesia (0.8 million tons).

The high workforce/GDP ratio (1.9 in 1990) is indicative of the rela- tively lower value added by agricultural workers compared with other sectors of the economy at the time.

This sustained growth has led to food surpluses and reduced poverty in the rural areas. The parallel high growth in industry and services, which have achieved a growth rate of three to four times that of agriculture has tended to in- crease the income gap between rural and urban areas and increased the rate of rural to urban migration. Agriculture has slowly had its dominant role in the economy reduced as the other sectors have grown faster. This is consistent with the experience in many other countries, and may presage an increased interest in part time farming by segments of Vietnam\u2019s rural population.

With yields of around 4.6t of paddy/ ha this is the least productive irrigated rice in Vietnam. Nationally there were around 6m ha of rice planted in 1990 and this figure had grown to around 7.5m ha by 2010. Dur- ing this same period national production more than doubled from 19mt of paddy to 40mt with the use of better seeds and better crop management. However the statistics indi- cate that the rate of growth of production has been slowing in recent years and may be reaching an economic limit with the current technologies available. The average yield of all types of paddy in 2010 was 5.32t/ha, and in 2011 5.53t/ ha. 1 \u201cMoving the Goal Posts: Vietnam\u2019s Evolving Rice Balance and Other Food Security Considerations\u201d by Steven Jaffee, NguyenDo Anh Tuan, Nguyen Ngoc Que, Dao The Anh, Nguyen The Dzung, Nguyen Ngoc Mai, Vu Nguyen, and Nguyen Anh Phong.

Modern retail channels, be it supermarkets or fast-food chains, will play a major role in future growth and will determine increasingly what type of a product is required. Also in Vietnam the working middleclass needs convenience and cannot afford to trek every day to the wet markets to purchase its meat, fruit and vegetables. Also the better-informed consumers realize that street vending and wet markets do not have the conditions to deliver a hygienic product. There are currently 636 supermarkets, 120 commercial centers and over 1000 convenience stores according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. This still does not seem to fulfill the demand. Local retail will need to receive some protection from the foreign investors by the government to create a level playing ground: the might of the established internationally operating retailers is too big for them to compete. Local retail is important to conserve a place for the local products on the shelves and"

Moving livestock production away from the people is a laudable move, but due to land and money restrictions not possible for all. Simple slurry and manure storage structures have to be designed, whereby composting with the now often burned rice straw would produce a tradable soil improvement commodity: compost. The technology to process manure and straw, even using worms such as Californian tiger worms to speed up the process has to be developed, extended and promoted. The continuous maize production on the sloping lands in the North is leading to erosion, in some places already severe erosion. Most of these areas are inhabited by ethnic minori- ties. The maize cultivation should be strongly embedded in a farming system of ruminant production, whereby the soil on the slopes if not through terracing then at least through grass strips is stabilized and farmers can use maize stover and cut grass from the anti-erosion strips to feed their live- stock.

ChapTer 5. fisheries and aquaCulTure introduction The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in Vietnam, which cover marine fisheries, inland fisheries and aquaculture, are a complex and important contributor to the country\u2019s economy and food security. They provide employment and foreign exchange earnings and essential animal protein for a large part of the population. Total national production is currently (2011) around 5.3m tons. There has been a major growth of the sectors during the last two decades. Marine capture fisheries increased over three times from 728,000 tons to about 2.0 million tons from around 1990 to 2010 while aquaculture increased nearly 20 fold from 162,000 tons to about 3.1 million tons. In addition, reports indicate that at least another 200,000 tons is derived from inland capture fisheries although this is probably underestimated (see below). Exports of part of the national production have been buoyant reaching some US$6 billion in 2011. The export volume represents about 40% of the total yield with the balance consumed domestically and contributing about 30% of the animal protein consumed in the country as compared to about"

Out of the marine catch reported for 2011 of 2.0 million tons from Vietnam\u2019s roughly 1 million km2 Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) 15% is exported (high value including tunas), 20% is consumed fresh as food, 35% goes to animal/fish feed (smaller species including juveniles) and fish meal and 30% is used for fish sauce (mainly sardines). Regarding the fishing potential in the EEZ, estimates have been made of the standing stocks and maximum sustain- able yields (MSY). The latest estimate of the standing stock by Vietnam\u2019s fisheries experts is about 5mt of which the MSY is estimated to be 2.15mt. Since the total 2011 catch was reported at 2.0 million tons from Vietnam\u2019s marine fisheries, these statistics suggest that the current yield is nearly at the MSY, which means that the standing stock is currently being fished near the currently estimated MSY. Due to the excessive fishing pressure in near-shore areas (roughly 80% of the estimated 130,000 fishing vessels with under 90 HP engine capacity in Vietnam fish within about 24 nautical miles (nm) of the shore which represent 25% of the EE) , it is likely that the near shore areas at least are over-fished. To help with fisheries management the government moni- tors the vessel engine capacity being used to fish in dif- ferent areas. Under the 2010 Prime Minister Decree 123/2006/ND-CP, fishing is currently restricted to areas and is being controlled in reference to fishing boat engine capacity. Within 1\u20136 nautical miles (nm) from the shore, only boats with engine capacities up to 20 HP are permit- ted to fish; between 6\u201324 nm boats with engine capacities"

Inland fisheries is perhaps the least understood sector in terms of yields as well as their relative importance to vari- ous stakeholder groups. Nearly all fish caught from inland capture fisheries are consumed domestically. The yield has been reported to be relatively stable at about 200,000 tons for many years. However detailed field assessments conducted by the Tropical Biology Institute of Ho Chi Minh City suggest that actual yields from inland fisheries could be much higher. For example the institute monitored production from the seasonally flooded 45,000-ha Omon-Xano area in Can Tho and An Giang Provinces in the Mekong Delta and found that production ranged from about 300\u2013450 kg/ha/ year depending on differences in annual hydrology. Extrapo- lating that yield to the average 1.3 million ha flooded area in the Delta conservatively\u2014assuming about 50% of the yield from the Omon-Xano area\u2014shows a possible annual yield ranging from about 200,000 tons to nearly 300,000 tons per year from the Delta alone. It is considered likely there- fore that the overall annual yield from inland capture fishes for the whole country is much larger than reported in the official statistics possibly up to double that reported. The importance of inland capture fisheries varies sig- nificantly among rural households. Beneficiaries can be land holders who are also involved in agriculture, or oth- ers whose income is derived mainly from day labor and other occupations. For these the fish catch can be either for subsistence, household consumption or possibly for supplemental income. There is another group whose main income is derived from more-or-less full time fishing with the majority of their catch sold"

On the downside, the rapid expansion of Pangasius production is also associated with major increases in water pollution of surface waters due to the discharge of water from regular exchanges. Brackish water aquaculture (15% of production) mainly involving shrimp farming (indigenous Penaeus monodon and exotic Penaeus vannamei from the central eastern Pacific) reached about 400,000 tons in 2011. It is a high risk/high reward endeavor because of disease risks. The farming of the indigenous Black Tiger Shrimp (Penaeus monodon) dominates and represents about 60% of the brackish water yield followed by fish (25%), other shrimps (11%) and other crustaceans (14%). Although Black Tiger Shrimp repre- sented 13% of the total aquaculture production in 2008, it represented 28% of the value that year. In comparison to Pangasius which represented about 50% of aquaculture yield, it equaled 40% of the total value that year. Because of the disease risk with shrimp cultivation and the consequent high financial risks, the expansion particularly of intensive shrimp aquaculture is discouraged by the government.

Toward developing an approach to rational coastal development, the Government is in the process of formulating and implementing integrated spatial management plans for near-shore areas. Three other im- portant dimensions to marine aquaculture development are that (i) it can be developed in areas adjacent to land with poor soils for agriculture where there are few other employ- ment opportunities, (ii) provide alternative employment to sea fishing and (iii) use filter-feeding organisms such as clams, mussels and scallops and seaweeds that do not require feed and can actually improve water quality through the assimilation of excess nutrients into growth. tAble 5.2: fisheries Products industriAl units\u20142000\u20132010 unit 2000 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 (e) no of Plants 225 439 470 490 544 568 570 capacity 1,000 ton 500 1,300 1,500 1,700 2,100 2,200 2,200 export 1,000 ton 300 634.5 821.7 942.4 1,240 1,216 1,300 26 AgriculturAl trAnsformAtion & food security 2040\u2014VietnAm country report fisheries Processing Vietnam\u2019s fisheries product processing industry is rela- tively modern producing diverse products, with some 570 industrial plants and thousands of manually operated units producing products with a value of around US$6 billion per year for export (2011).

While this figure of 6m will have been reduced since 2008 as the economy has grown, it can be expected that there are still many Vietnamese who do not have a sufficient income to provide an adequate nutritious meal for their families with- out some income support in cash or in kind.

Compared with an estimated average national consumption of around 120kg/per person /year in 2010 (GSO), actual national rice production per capita in 2011 was around 200\u2013250kg of rice grain for each person even after highly conservative adjustments are made for satisfying seed retention needs of the farmers for the following season\u2019s crop, feed for animals and a generous allowance for post harvest losses. This comfortable excess of rice produc- tion over national needs underlines that unless there are dramatic changes in the current production pattern Vietnam is in a highly secure position regarding rice production for national consumption. In addition the national retail market for food products is now quite well developed which adds a huge safety factor to the food security calculation. This has allowed Vietnam to pursue an active export program to ASEAN partners and worldwide. 2011 exports had reached a high point of over 7mT of rice (Table 6.3). The above data are difficult to assemble because of the broad range of rice growing conditions in Vietnam. The selected values must be considered to be an approximate estimate describing this broad rice production situation in Vietnam by taking averages of what is actually happen- ing on different farms. Yields will vary widely in different regions and according to the seeds used, the season of planting, whether the crop is irrigated or rainfed, the skill of the farmer in managing his farm, input use, etc. Apart from production figures there are three key variables which can impact results as they do in this table.

The government tracks actively the evolving state of nutrition in the country and takes proactive measures to improve nutrition. UN agencies are active in support of nutrition policies including FAO and UNICEF, as well as bilateral agencies from the Development Partners. There is a National Food Security Strategy and a National Nutri- tion Strategy in place in 2012, with plans for improving the current situation and perspective plans through 2030. Key Ministries involved are: Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agri- culture and Rural Development, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Education and Training, Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism, Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs. A recent survey (NIN 2010) shows that in 2009 the aver- age daily energy intake of the Vietnamese population was 1,925 kcals and it had just about remained the same as two decades before. However there is a difference in the consumption patterns between the two periods. In the later period, as people have become richer, there were less car- bohydrates and more protein and lipids in the diet. Over the years, the diet has changed, and become more healthy.

Many of these hope for the continued strong growth of the agriculture sector to enable them to escape from poverty. We note that poverty is very much a rural phe- nomenon with some 70\u201380% of the poor living in the rural areas. Agriculture and rural development is closely linked to all Vietnam\u2019s poverty alleviation efforts. A good growth in agriculture has an immediate payoff in reduced poverty and therefore reduced food poverty. Vietnam\u2019s rural development efforts through a series of National Target Programs (see below) have also played an important role in the poverty alleviation programs. Vietnam has been very successful in poverty alleviation efforts in the last two decades as can be seen from Figures 6.1\u20136.3. The GOV Household Surveys show that poverty, and hence food security issues, have become increasingly concen- trated among ethnic minorities living in mountainous areas, who make up nearly 15 percent of the population. In 2008, 50 percent of minorities lived below the poverty line, com- pared to only 9 percent of Kinh-Hoa majorities. By 2010, ethnic minorities accounted for 65 percent of individuals in the poorest welfare decile, up from 53 percent in 2006.

When fully implement- ed, current plans are that this would be by around 2020, these programs will provide a broad safety net for the poor. In the meantime the major driver of poverty alleviation and food security for the poor is agriculture and rural develop- ment which has been the main factor driving down the rural poverty rate in the last two decades. So far the continu- ous reduction in the occurrence of poverty that has been achieved in the last two decades suggests that government strategy is successful so far and, if continued, should lead to good progress in the future. Apart from broad national social security programs the GOV has developed a series of \u201cNational Target Programs\u201d to spur local economic development and help the rural poor and the disadvantaged. Program 135, provides support to communes facing hardship in ethnic minority and moun- tainous areas. Programs 132 and 134 target vulnerable ethnic minorities using different criteria. Program 132 aims at distributing agricultural and residential land to ethnic minority households in the Central Highlands, so as to bring landholdings up to a specified minimum. Program 134 targets all ethnic minorities. In addition to providing land, this program provides financial support for housing construction and utilities (mainly clean water) for the poor.

The success of Vietnam\u2019s agricultural sector can be judged by the ability to meet local demand while also exporting large quantities of rice and fish. Various scenarios of future GDP, population, and changing diets indicate that Vietnam will still be able to continue to meet most domestic de- mands and have surplus production for exports. Thus unlike some of the other ASEAN members, food security is not a major issue for the country.

For agricul- ture the major turnaround in sector performance occurred in the eighties when Vietnam turned away from the system in place involving the management /involvement by the gov- ernment of all the factors of production to a return to family farming and an acceptance of the role that the market could play in Vietnam. The government introduced a broad ranging \u201crenovation program\u201d (doi moi) which transformed the economy and stimulated an extraordinary growth of industrial production, construction, services and agriculture. As part of this reform, the government introduced private farming by granting land use rights to farmers. As described by Thomas Wiens,1 the doi moi reforms that had the great- est impact on rural areas included: 1. Dismantling the collective system and returning agriculture to family farming on the basis of long- term leases. 2. Abandoning administered pricing. 3. Devaluing the exchange rate and maintaining a managed float, exposing the farm sector to levels and fluctuations in international prices. 4. Partitioning the single state bank into sectoral banks, including an agricultural bank offering credit not only to state enterprises and collectives but also to individual family farms at positive and roughly nondiscriminatory real interest rates. 1 See Chapter by Thomas B.

Production increased across the board not only for rice but for most other crops. Food production increased by around 1 million T/year even though there were decreases in food produc- tion areas planted (by 220,000ha) as farmers responded to price signals and sought increased labor productivity through diversification to other crops, or abandoned land that was not productive. New seed varieties reached 90% of rice areas, 80% of maize areas and 60% of sugarcane. The 2006\u201310 socio economic plan continued this more market based growth of the sector.

Land availability is a limiting factor for Vietnamese agricul- ture and there is almost no opportunity for horizontal expan- sion of cropping so that the optimization of land productivity is a key factor when assessing growth potential. Vietnam currently has about 9.4m ha of land used for agriculture of which around 6.4m ha is used for growing annual crops and 3.0m ha for perennial crops. Two thirds of the annual cropland is rice land which is planted with up to three crops of rice but an average of nearly two crops (1.8 in 2011). Aquaculture is developed on about 750,000 ha. Farms are now mostly privately run using land on long term leases from the government. Most farms are split into several quite dispersed plots, up to 20 units in extreme cases, but typi- cally 4\u20135 units, leading to considerable inefficiencies in land use and management.

Beyond that, a major land issue that will have to be faced in the coming years beyond improved land registration is farm size.

It also reduces the opportunity for introducing farm mechanization which will be needed to offset future expected labor shortages in the rural areas. The restructuring and modernization of farming during the next three decades should involve a program to facilitate the increase in farm sizes through land consoli- dation. This will permit farmers to generate more income and make farming a more attractive proposition and hence improve the sustainability of the sector. Major objectives that need to be achieved include (i) a stability of rights to use land for a period of time which en- courages investment by farmers; (ii) land consolidation that can lead to efficient commercial farms; (iii) more flexible arrangements to access land for economic use. irrigation and Flood protection Irrigation is a key part of the food production story in Vietnam and has played an important part in the success of Vietnam\u2019s efforts to upgrade agricultural production in the last two decades. According to FAO, the irrigation potential in Vietnam is 9.4 million ha of which in 2012 close to one half has been developed. Investment in irrigation and flood protection has been a major focus of the government since the \u201870\u2019s with some 80% of the capital investment funds available to the agriculture sector allocated to improving and expanding irrigation, and protecting flood prone areas from damage.

The actual area currently equipped for irrigation, the state of repair of the irrigation systems and other statistics on irrigation in Vietnam are uncertain because of confusion on definitions and weaknesses in data collection. To remedy this the GOV has recently started a new nationwide census of irrigation but results are not yet forthcoming. FAO records that in 2005 the total equipped area for irrigation was about 4.6m ha or 50 percent of the potential. Other sources record smaller areas but this may be because they do not include small scale private irrigation. FAO detailed the type of existing irrigation schemes as 1.6m ha in small irriga- tion systems (< 5 000 ha), 1.2m ha in medium irrigation schemes (5 000\u201350 000 ha) and 1.7m ha of large irriga- tion schemes (> 50 000 ha). About 2.1m ha were pump irrigated. Around two-thirds of the total irrigation area is in the two large deltas (in the Red River delta, and in the Mekong delta). Supporting these irrigation networks are an estimated 5,600 reservoirs which store water and supply water when needed, supplementing water diverted directly from rivers. Over 11,500 pumps lift water to higher ground when water levels are too low to reach fields. Many hydraulic works are now 30\u201340 years old and have not been well maintained so that much rehabilitation or refurbishment is needed. Many systems do not fully irrigate the area for which they were designed.

Research has con- tributed in plant breeding programs, introduction of new breeds, diversification of crops and improved pest and dis- ease management. In the fisheries sector impressive gains have been made through adaptation and development of intensive aquaculture systems. In forestry the introduction of fast growing trees such as acacia, development of agro- forestry systems and intensification of bamboo production has given rise to a large (although highly over-capacity) pulp and paper industry.

The skeleton for a sustainable national agriculture research system is in place. However low levels of investment, a disconnect between research and the mar- ket for research outputs and outcomes, a closed research system, inability to recruit and retain competent researchers coupled with over-investment in land and buildings and high overhead costs has the potential to threaten sustainability.

At the same time this would improve market opportunities for Vietnamese farmers who lose a lot of market value for their products because of the limited choice of outlets for their production. For existing processed products, quality in general is not high except in some enclave areas, and goods produced are monotonous with lower competitiveness, value, and export prices. Most agricultural products (coffee, cashew nuts, rubber, fruits and vegetables, seafood) are still exported as semi-processed or preliminarily processed, with low value added, and without a reputed brand name (which usually adds value) and modern packaging.

Recent official studies also found high levels of lead, copper and E coli in vegetables grown in \u201csafe zones\u201d in Northern provinces, at- tributed to excessive use of fertilizer, pesticides and improp- erly composted manure. Also there are ongoing concerns about increasing concentrations on carcinogenic dioxins in the food chain, related to Agent Orange herbicide spraying during the US-Vietnam war. The following table from work 3 JICA has been providing technical assistance to Vietnam to help improve the quality of exports of food products, particularly products from aquaculture. by UNIDO assesses the level of risk of rejection by the US and EU of some of Vietnam\u2019s food exports: Rejections of imports of various Vietnamese products by the US, EU and Japan for not meeting required standards continue at a relatively high rate compared with many other countries, but the rejection rate is on the decline. Recorded rejections in the above cited UNIDO report for US and EU (similar data for Japan are not available from the UNIDO analysis) were as shown in Table 7.3. The above situation notwithstanding, the conditions in the seafood sector, which is a strictly regulated export sec- tor, are better. In Vietnam, in 2011, all 534 industrial scale units met mandatory requirement of HAACP certification compared to 80 units in 1990.

Vietnam\u2019s population of 89 million has experienced a rapid decline in birth rates during the recent past and further declines are being projected by GSO/UN. This would imply the population is likely to level off at around 104 million. Presently the population is made up of ethnic Vietnamese (86% of the total); the rest are some 54 ethnic minorities residing in hilly areas and comprise the poorest segment of the population. With rapidly declining birth rates and rising life expectancy, the country is gradually starting to age; projections show that by 2040 fewer than 32 percent of the people will be under the age of 25 while 20 percent will be over 60.1 Changes in the age profile combined with growing rural-urban migration have started to affect labor availability in the agricultural sector and with time this may become a major constraint. Another potential issue is the country\u2019s population density, which is one of the highest in Southeast Asia.

Second, a steady and significant rise in rural wages as a result of three mutually reinforcing factors: (i) rural to urban migration and the gradual ageing of the rural population; (ii) availability of higher paying off-farm jobs (services, agri- 1 Vietnam Development Report 2006: Social Security. business) in rural areas; and (iii) overall higher income and wage levels in the countries as a result of higher economic growth and higher productivity. The only way agriculture can remain profitable at these higher wage levels will be to sharply increase productivity and shift to higher-value crops. In each instance the migration to urban areas as more and more laborers leave their farms in search of employment in the cities will impact labor availability for farm work and exert pressure on the provision of urban services. Changes in the demographics of other ASEAN countries may affect the scope and direction of future rice exports from Vietnam. UN projections generally indicate a rapid slowdown in the growth rate of population for the ASEAN member countries and two VIP countries, with only the Philippines continuing to register a relatively high population growth rate of 1.4 percent per year.

Clearly such a big difference in total population will have major consequences for food demand security. urbAnizAtion The current rate of urbanization in Vietnam of 29\u201330% is low compared with regional averages of 40\u201342% but urbanization in Vietnam is now proceeding quite rapidly, driven by the flight of younger workers from the rural areas in search of higher paid employment in industry, services and construction in urban areas. In the early nineties the urbanization rate was estimated to be close to 20% (GSO) but now GSO projections are that the level could well reach over 50% (52%) by 2040. From a situation of excess labor in the rural areas since the nineties, in 2040 a tighter labor market in the rural areas can be expected. This will encour- age investment in mechanization in the coming years which should lead in turn to higher labor productivity. However the increased settlement in urban areas and the parallel growth of industry will also require land to be converted to urban and industrial use, and in many cases taken out of agriculture. It will be advisable to protect some of the best agricultural land through zoning the land for continued agricultural use while allocating poorer quality agricultural land for urban and industrial use. globAl And regionAl trAde Agreements With all ASEAN countries except for Laos being members of WTO, trade between members should be able to move freely provided it complies with existing health safety regu- lations.

It would seem that there is concern among some members that without tariff and non-tariff barriers\u2019 to protect local producers, they will not be able to compete with the internationally traded goods on price, product quality and safety standards. A study by the World Bank shows that, in the case of VIP countries, hidden trade barriers (mostly import restrictions) and extra payments or bribes are (Table 18) are significant; this is likely to be a challenge to closer trade integration. At the country level, traders in Vietnam still appear to struggle with hidden trade barriers, while in the Philippines both trade barriers and extra payments are a constraint; condi- tions in Indonesia are slightly better but here too trade barri- ers are an issue.

APProAch to food security And self sufficiency From primary concentration on the volume and stability of food supplies in the 1970s, the concept of food security has gradually evolved to include food access by the poor. This study adopts FAO\u2019s widely accepted formulation of food security that defines it as a \u201ccondition that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\u201d. In most ASEAN countries\u2014including VIP countries\u2014food security is an important plank of national agricultural policy and is often equated with self-sufficiency. The focus of food security and self-sufficiency is primarily on rice. Countries have a much more open policy towards other food com- modities, such as corn and wheat. An interventionist food policy regime in grain markets was firmly entrenched in Asia during the 1970s, with the direct involvement of the governments. This involvement included the following: accumulation and release of buffer stocks to stabilize prices; monopoly controls over international trade; restrictions on"

The GOV still maintains a strong policy linkage between national food security and national self-sufficiency in rice. The current policy is that best way to ensure food security is to aim at national self-sufficiency in rice. The evolution of this self-sufficiency policy in the coming years has major implications for the development of agriculture in Vietnam. For example a relaxation of the self-sufficiency objective and a reliance on trade to cover any rice deficiencies could allow a different use of land by some farmers and a higher value of production by the sector, depending on market prices. Possible options in this direction are analyzed in the next section covering the demand and supply of food crops. We note that self-sufficiency in rice was an important con- sideration for Vietnam in the past because internal markets were not well developed and many consumers preferred to rely on their own production for food security rather than consumer retail market access. However now retail markets are well established and this consumer concern in Vietnam is already diminishing. Recent surveys (Jaffee, et al) showed that many rice farmers in the Mekong delta now sell their rice production at harvest and repurchase rice supplies from retail suppliers when needed2. 2 Jaffee: op cit.

Food security will remain at a high level because of the high level of technology that will be adapted by Vietnamese scientists for use in Vietnam from international and national sources. Sector exports will also continue grow as farmers diversify into higher value crops, while maintaining significant rice exports to ASEAN and other importers. The major challenge will be to satisfy the burgeoning internal demand for pork and poultry, a result of the greatly increased purchasing power of consumers in a rapidly growing economy. Farms can be expected to be bigger on average than they are today as commercial farming has become more im- portant and many farmers will have taken advantage of government plans to support land consolidation programs. With more efficient farming units from land consolidation, farm incomes can be expected to be greatly improved, allowing rural salaries to match urban levels more closely. However there will also remain a large group of older farm- ers involved in part time farming who continue farming as a food security endeavor. Key changes in the sector which will upgrade or change performance: \u2022 Changes in the diet: With rising incomes, Vietnam- ese consumers will be consuming less rice, more protein (meat and fish), and more nutritious fruits and vegetables. Consumers will also be demanding higher quality products. Farmers will have changed their cropping patterns to respond to these chang- ing food consumption patterns and industrial demands for these higher value and higher quality crops which will also increase value added and farm incomes. \u2022 Shift to animal feedcrops: In response to the sub- stantial increase in the demand from local feedmills for raw materials for animal feed to support the high growth in demand for meat, some 1.5\u20132.0 million ha of farmland will include crops to be used as"

In this section we analyze consumption of various food items using the centennial model optimistic and pessi- mistic scenarios described at the start of this report: i.e. the 2040 Centennial optimistic scenario and the 2040 Centen- nial pessimistic scenario. In addition to rice, we model other key commodities such as protein rich foods: pork, beef, chicken and fish. Fruits and vegetables will also be in high demand but these are already widely produced in Vietnam and increased production is responsive to market demand. Wheat is a popular imported item which is in high demand and which is not produced in Vietnam. Consumption projections from the centennial model for 2040 with comparisons for 2010 are summarized below in the following tables giving the estimated aggregate national consumption and per capita annual consumption estimates: rice As described above, in 2011 Paddy production was report- ed by MARD to be 42.3mt, reaching a peak production level of more than double the 1990 production level of 19mt.

This amount of rice is equivalent to 224% (i.e. more than double) of Vietnam\u2019s rice needs for human consumption of 10.2mt in that year. This current excess of production over internal needs gives a correct impression of the high level of rice security in Vietnam on a national supply and demand basis at the present. This high level of security allows Vietnam to export substantial quantities of rice, bringing in valuable foreign exchange. Rice exports currently account for some 35% of agricultural exports (i.e. excluding wood and fisheries exports). Scenarios for paddy production in the coming period up to 2040 must provide for many different eventualities. The primary variables will be the amount of land that is used for paddy production and the number of rice rotations on the land. Current government strategy for food security is based on a policy of self-sufficiency to ensure that 3.8m. ha of ricelands are designated as such and must be used for rice production. The Provincial governments have also assessed the amount of land needed for rice security and have pro- posed that 3.6m. ha would be sufficient. At this stage"

We do know that the policy is costly and because it constrains the diversification of agriculture in some areas as described above. The self-sufficiency policy can also be expected to reduce the prospects for the growth of the sector in the coming years by preventing some market based changes in cropping by some rice farmers. Already it is estimated that some 400,000\u2013600,000 ha could now be \u201creleased\u201d for the cultivation of other crops if farmers find a financial interest in diversification. Current average levels of rotation of about 1.8 can be assumed up to 2040 as a con- servative assumption (meaning that the number rice crops grown on the same plot of land will average 1.8 crops). If 3.6\u20133.8m ha are dedicated to rice this implies some 7m ha of planted rice area at current levels of activity (actual for 2011 was 7.6m ha) Another key variable which will affect rice production through 2040 is the yield levels being obtained by farmers for each of the three rice crops being planted: the Spring paddy, Autumn paddy and the Winter paddy and the balance between these three crops. Recent yields were recorded as follows for 2010 (see chapter 5): Spring paddy: 6.2t/ha, Autumn paddy 4.8 t/ha, winter paddy 4.6t/ha. For statistical purposes the yields are averaged out every year by MARD. The 2011 average for the three crops was 5.5t/ha. what will this average yield Figure be in 2040? The average yield in 2040 is unlikely to be less than the 2011 yield of 5.5t/ha given the success of Vietnamese farmers in the past in taking advantage of new varieties and improved cultivation techniques"

From 2006-2010 the yield growth rate fell as yield growth limits started to be reached, but was still 1.7%/year. In addition any land taken out of production for other uses in the coming years will most likely be at the lower end of the yield spectrum which would tend to increase the average remaining yields. Given past performance it would be highly conservative to assume an average paddy yield of 6.5t/ha by 2040 compared with the present yield level of 5.5t/ha in a pessimistic rice production scenario for 2040. This implies a yield growth of 0.65%/year from 2012\u20132040 compared with the current growth rate of 1.7%/year. An optimistic scenario would assume new progress by the research establishment in more exotic rice varieties such as hybrid rice or C4 rice.

However Vietnamese consumers are becoming more demanding as incomes have been ris- ing and there is a danger that in the future the market for lower quality production may be less open to Vietnam at the price Vietnamese farmers would expect. Over time farmers should move upmarket to secure the market. Vietnam will have to decide which end of the market they want to be.

The \u2018convergence\u2019 idea is this: It has been observed that the convergers\u2019 incomes catch up to those of global best practice over time, and that convergers with lower incomes converge more quickly. Three main forces drive conver- gence: First, open economy forces yield convergent growth if poorer countries focus on their comparative and factor ad- vantages and then trade with nations lacking those factors, e.g., cheap labor. This leads to more equal cross-country factor prices. Second, capital deepening boosts growth more in countries with lower ratios of capital to skilled labor (usually the poorer ones) due to the nature of diminishing returns. The third force is productivity convergence. Here it is the TFP of convergers that catches up to that of best practice, with those further behind in TFP converging faster. This phenomenon reflects technology leap-frogging, technol- ogy transfers, shifting underemployed agriculture workers to efficient export-led manufacturing, transferring child laborers into schools, a steady increase in the average level of literacy, building roads to connect the unconnected to markets, and the diffusion of management and operational research from more advanced countries. It appears that countries can shortcut productivity-improvement processes 1 This subsection is taken from Kohli, Szyf, and Arnold (2012). by learning from economies that are already at the produc- tivity frontier.

The first step in this process is to estimate per capita total consumption. We calculate consumption in constant PPP international dol- lars (both for base year 2010 and base year 2005) as the GDP PPP PC times the share of GDP spent on consumption. To estimate the latter, we begin with the historical series of the ratio of consumption to GDP from the Penn World Table (Heston, Summers, & Aten, 2009).7 We then estimate future consumption using the following autoregression across all countries and years: where i is the country, t is the year, C is the share of GDP spent on consumption, CappedGDPPC is the minimum of $50,000 and the GDP PPP PC in constant 2010 PPP dol- lars, the \u03b2s are the coefficients, and \u03b5 is the error term. 7 Heston, Alan, Summers, Robert, & Aten, Bettina.

As a country\u2019s total income increases, more people with small shares of the country\u2019s total will attain higher living standards. We use a type of income distribution curve called a GQ Lorenz curve (Kohli, Szyf, & Arnold, 2012). We calculate these shares using the following GQ-Lorenz-based headcount function (the share of the country\u2019s population below per capita income level z in a given year): where H(z) is the headcount index, \u03bc is the country\u2019s mean consumption level per capita in 2010 PPP dollars, and the other letters are parameters that describe the shape of the income distribution (Kohli, Szyf, & Arnold, 2012), with values taken from Povcal (World Bank Development Research Group, 2011).8 For our food consumption model, we will also need to calculate percentile incomes, that is, what is the income (or consumption level) so that a given percentage of the popu- lation lives under that level. For percentile pct, the following equation identifies below which income level it is that pct% of the population lives: where GDPPC is either the income or consumption level per capita, pct% is the percentage of the population, and the other terms are the same as in the previous equation. The model also generates poverty measures for all ASEAN countries except Myanmar. However, the GQ Lorenz curve (and hence the headcount formula above) is not as accurate for extremely low incomes (Kohli, Szyf, & Arnold,"

Retrieved 12/13/2010 http://go.worldbank.org/WE8P1I8250 population lives below the poverty line) is the value of H(z) that makes the following equation true (Datt, 1998):9 where \u03f4, \u03b3, and \u03b4 are the parameters that characterize the income distribution (with values taken from Povcal (2012)), z is the poverty line ($1.25 per day, measured in constant 2005 PPP dollars), and \u03bc is the country\u2019s mean consump- tion level per capita in constant 2005 PPP dollars. This headcount index tells us how many poor there are, but not how poor they are. A country with all the poor living just below the poverty line would get the same score as a country with the same rate of poverty but with most of the poor living on incomes below half the poverty level. To estimate the magnitude of poverty, we use the poverty gap. This takes into account how far below the poverty line the average poor person is. More precisely, it measures what share of the society\u2019s resources would have to be transferred to the poor to eliminate poverty. The poverty gap equals where z is the poverty line and H is the H(z) defined in the previous equation (Datt, 1998). However, for the Philippines 2040 estimates, we do not use the above equations for the poverty gap and headcount because its Beta Lorenz curve is not valid (Povcal, 2012). Instead, we use the GQ-Lorenz headcount function above and the poverty gap equation given in Kohli, Szyf, and Arnold (2012).10 9 Datt, Gaurav. (1998).

(This pattern already takes into account urban-rural differences.) For each year, the macro model computes what fraction of the population is in each cohort. The final per capita food consumption number equals the weighed average of how much each cohort consumes, weighed by each cohort\u2019s share of the total population. As the country grows richer, the number of people in each cohort changes, and so the country\u2019s average consumption changes, as illustrated in the following two charts for egg consumption in Indonesia. In each chart, the horizontal axis represents a person\u2019s consumption income per year, in 2010 PPP dollars (as we will see below, we use PPP because we will be extrapolating between different countries\u2019 experiences of how much food each eats, for which PPP is a better measure). The blue line represents a population density function: what the prob- ability is that a random person in the country will have that level of consumption. (The vertical axis values are arbitrary and are not shown.) The higher the value of the blue line, the more people in the country have the consumption level indicated by the corresponding value of on the x axis.

While researchers will point to impressive increases in agriculture production, much of those increases can be attributed to policy changes such as \u201cdoi moi\u201d, increases in planted areas, rehabilita- tion of irrigation systems and increases in inputs, notably fertiliser. Research has contributed, especially in plant breeding programs, introduction of new breeds, diversifica- tion of crops and improved pest and disease management. In the fisheries sector impressive gains have been made through adaptation and development of intensive aqua- culture systems and in the forestry the introduction of fast growing trees such as acacia, development of agro-forestry systems and intensification of bamboo production has given rise to a large (although highly over-capacity) pulp and paper industry. Almost all of the research gains have been achieved through adaptive rather than innovative research.

These cost norms are well out of date and do not relate to actual cost. This impacts the nature, scope and quality of research undertaken through a reduction in treatments and replicates and through that the quality of research. It also encourages on-station rather than on-farm research through savings on transport costs. All research projects have to acquit all expenditure through provision of receipts which are required to exactly match the project budget.

Some of these increases can be attributed to improved varieties but much of this increase could be attributed to the relatively high nitrogen inputs, improved irrigation and water management and improved but very dependent chemical control of pests and diseases. the rate of increase in rice productivity has significantly slowed from around 3.5% per year to now 1% per year. this level of increase is expected to be maintained as a result small gains from research and increased adoption of improved agronomic and harvest and post-harvest practices. From a research perspective, given the results to date and the international research programs in irri and other major rice producing countries the conventional rice research field could be considered mature (see the research \u201cS\u201d curve). this means that the returns for further investment in traditional rice improvement programs are unlikely to provide cost-effective benefits. the challenge is to initiate another \u201cS\u201d curve through advanced scientific techniques possibly involving genetically modified organisms. there are three potential op- tions (i) Hybrid rice: the anticipated benefit from hybrid rice is 15\u201320% increase in yield. vietnam researchers have tried to develop hybrid rice varieties since the mid-1990s with limited success. the yield increases have not matched those reported in other countries, notably china. the production of hybrid rice seed requires spe- cific techniques for success and adoption of hybrid rice produced in vietnam is low. in china almost 50% of the rice area utilises hybrid rice and some"

Within MOST there is a view that output based contracts with payments for defined deliv- erables will only work if the research is successful. The notion of success is that it provides substantial impact and unless that occurs the results will not be achieved and therefore output payments will not be appropriate. The concepts of a null hypothesis or alternate hypothesis appear not well understood as evidence that supports the null hypothesis (i.e. the treatments do not work) is considered as less important (and therefore a failure) than evidence that rejects the null hypothesis. The net result of this understanding is that researchers tend to submit project proposals that they know will be successful rather than test the boundaries of in- novation. This approach significantly lowers impact. 3. High technology in agriculture is seen as the introduction of large scale farming systems where mechanization has replaced labor. From a Vietnam- ese research perspective almost all of this technol- ogy is readily imported as evidenced by the large annex 2 92 AgriculturAl trAnsformAtion & food security 2040\u2014VietnAm country report scale and often foreign owned large scale intensive commercial pig and poultry units and increasingly large dairy production systems. The question to ask is how can Vietnamese research improve the impact of these large scale mechanised farming systems? 4. Availability of salary supplementation through internationally supported projects gives rise to a concern that the research agenda can be driven by the donors."

Potential sources for this include: 1. Government funding: It is considered unlikely that government will meet this increase on its own, especially if research continues to have difficulty in demonstrating a sound return on government investment. Policies and strategies that enable government to leverage private sector funding sup- port and options such as levies and interest bearing loans to research institutions for development of partnerships with the private sector could narrow the funding gap and encourage a closer collabora- tion with agro-industry. 2.

Agriculture research is an international commodity and there is ready access to lit- erature via the internet. English language may be a problem for older researchers but most of the younger well qualified researchers have obtained benefits from donor supported scholarships where English is the teaching language. Yet in spite of this, observation of many Vietnamese research projects over the last six years including some research and development projects funded by donors, demonstrates a relatively poor understanding of existing knowledge and experience and too many research and development proposals that repeat what is already known and proven.

Apart from this Government agencies receive most of their salary from government and land and buildings and most administration and management overheads and research equipment is provided by government through a direct grant from MARD to research institutes. Under Decree 115 (and subsequently Decision 96) salaries were to be included in the costs of research. This move is laudable but as yet has not been implemented. Some care also needs to be taken with this policy as international experience has shown that core research institute funding is necessary to enable research institutes to build and maintain capacity. If open and con- testable output based contracts are implemented the ability of the private sector to compete will remain low as the only way they can recover overhead costs is to use a salary multiplier to recover overhead costs.

These and several other de- crees and decisions have been promulgated in reference to the statutes in Vietnam\u2019s 2003 Fisheries Law. Considering their recent enactment, in time their effectiveness will be realized and be important in sustaining fisheries in Vietnam to optimal economic levels. With regard to establishing fishing effort levels, the Re- search Institute for Marine Fisheries has been charged by the government to via a 2011\u20132015 $8-million program to recalculate the standing biomass and maximum sustainable yield of fisheries in Vietnam. To complement that program, it would also be useful to calculate the maximum economic yield1 (MEY) from fisheries which would be below the MSY in terms of volume. The Government\u2019s plan at present is to limit the fish catch to the currently estimated MSY of about 2 million tons until a re-estimation of the above factors is completed. This will require controlling the issuance of fishing licenses for which at present there are no controls, meaning that essentially the fisheries in Vietnam are and will continue to be open ac- cess until measures are enacted to control fishing intensity. 1 The MEY is the fishing effort where the positive difference been the value of all opportunity costs\u2014including labor, capital and operation\u2014and revenue is maximized. For MSY, the level of harvest is based on the maximum sustainable yield regardless of economic and financial benefits. The MEY is usually below the MSY.

Inland fisheries is perhaps the least understood sector in terms of yields as well as their relative importance to vari- ous stakeholder groups. Nearly all fish caught from inland capture fisheries are consumed domestically. The yield has been reported to be relatively stable at about 200,000 tons. However, this yield could possibly be established based on the traded fish only and not that caught for subsistence, household consumption. Detailed assessments conducted by the Tropical Biology Institute of Ho Chi Minh City show that the production from seasonally flooded 45,000-ha Omon-Xano area in Can Tho and An Giang Provinces in the Mekong Delta ranged from about 300\u2013450 kg/ha/year which fluctuated mainly due to the differences in annual hydrology. Extrapolating that yield to the average 1.3 million ha flooded area in the Delta conservatively\u2014assuming about 50% of the yield from the Omon-Xano area\u2014shows a possible annual yield ranging from about 200,000 tons to nearly 300,000 tons per year, assuming a 50% production level overall than that recorded in the studied area. There- fore, the overall annual yield from inland capture fishes for the country is likely much larger than assumed. Also, the importance of inland capture fisheries varies significantly among rural households. For those land holders who are also involved in agriculture or others whose income is derived mainly from day labor and other occupations, for those involved in inland fisheries, the fish catch likely is for subsistence, household consumption and possibly for supplemental income.

The longest history is with fresh- water aquaculture systems that also include integrated farming models where aquaculture is combines with animal husbandry and agriculture where the by-products of each are cycles as nutrients for the others. For those integrated systems, generally fish polyculture in ponds is conducted where species are stocked together to take advantage of available nutrients and feeds. Nevertheless, over the past decade, freshwater aquaculture has been dominated by the rise of Pangasius catfish whose production in monoculture grew from about 114,000 tons to the current level of about 1.2 million tons or a compounded increase of about 27% per year. Pangasius now represents about 40% of the total aquaculture value and is the highest foreign exchange earner, about 30% of total export sales for the country from fisheries and aquaculture at about US$2 billion in 2011. Associated particularly with the rapid expansion of Pangas- ius production has been major increase in water pollution of surface waters due to the discharge of water from regular exchanges.

In comparison to Pangasius which represented about 50% of aquaculture yield, it equaled 40% of the total value that year. The relative value of shrimp aquaculture, though, is overshadowed by the disease risks from which pandemics can more seriously impact those cops in comparison to others. The Government\u2019s position, therefore, is not to expand shrimp aquaculture significantly from its current level, especially intensive farming due to the relatively higher financial and economic risks as compared to less intensive forms. Marine aquaculture production is in its early stages of development and includes the culture of lobsters, grouper cobia, clams, seaweeds, barramundi and a number of other species. The expansion of marine aquaculture development has been slow. Nevertheless, the is enormous scope for its development, provided that sites are carefully selected to avoid or resolve conflicts with other uses of the sea area, carrying capacity limits are not exceeded and the invest- ments can be targeted for areas that have acceptable risk to coastal storms. Toward developing an approach to rational coastal development, the Government is in the process of formulating and implementing integrated spatial manage- ment plans for near-shore areas. Three other important dimensions to marine aquaculture development are that it can be done in areas with poor soils for agriculture, provide alternative employment to fishing and use filter-feeding organisms such as clams, mussels and scallops and seaweeds that do not require feed and can actually improve water quality through the assimilation of excess"

Profit margin. Generally, the profit margin for fishers is dif- ficult to generalize; however, reported information in 2010 shows that it is quite narrow for two of the major fisheries in Vietnam. For tuna which is caught offshore, the margin is very narrow due to the relatively high operating cost or about 3% of the revenue or about VND400 per kilogram with a sale price of VND14,000/kg. For anchovies that are caught in near-shore waters, the profit margin varies de- pending on the landed quality that is used for export, direct domestic consumption and fish sauce. The profit margin for export quality is about 77% (VND15,400) and about 54% for direct domestic consumption (VND5,400) with average price around VND20,000/kg for the former and VND10,000/ kg for the latter. Anchovies used for fish sauce can essential be considered by catch that is separated from the above two sources and sold at about VND4,500/kg which if it were the only fish landed by the vessels would result is a net loss of about VND80/kg. The surveyed production cost per kg of anchovy caught is VND4,578 all inclusive with the off- loaded value and use determined by the quality of the catch when it reaches port and which of the harvest are suit- able for the various demands. Clearly, the better on-board, post-harvest quality the higher the benefit will be per fishing trip, if market demand remains the same with the greater portion of high valued anchovies.

Although on-shore process- ing needs are well met by the seafood processing industry, onboard equipment on fishing vessels often is in adequate with regard to effectively preserving the catch.

As a result of the subsidies, unlicensed fishing vessels registered in order to take advantage of the subsidy which provided the Government with a better tally of the mechanized fishing fleet overall. Prior to that in the late 1990s and early 2000s subsidies were provided for fishing boat construction that has been attributed to contributing the excessively high fish- ing pressure on available resources.

As a result, many proces- sors were reported to have suspended operations due to lack of raw material from growers. For semi-intensive and intensive shrimp farming, feed represents roughly 68% of the production costs; but, more importantly the production profit per kg of shrimp is about VND46,000 versus VND550/kg for catfish. Similar feed cost issues affect nearly all finfish (marine, brackish and freshwater); however, the impact is somewhat less for those integrated fish farming systems where combinations of indigenous and exotic species in polyculture are able to derive their nutrition from the by-products of animal husbandry and agriculture as fertilizers and feeds, respectively, as well as from farm raised forage by some fish species. Obviously, bivalve and seaweed aquaculture require no feeds but do need an environment in which plankton and nutrients are adequate for efficient growth. \u2022 Disease. Most forms of aquaculture are threatened by disease. Except for shrimp aquaculture, pro- phylactic measures are generally well understood.

In Vietnam, there is tremendous scope for the expansion of marine aquacul- ture. To complement this, a planning process needs to be put in place for the use of coastal waters. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment\u2019s (MONRE) Vietnam Administration of Seas and Islands (VASI) was established in 2008 to develop, among its tasks, integrated spatial planning (ISP) of coastal areas.

In addition to this expansion in yields particularly from aquaculture, the Government plans to modernize and improve the overall efficiency of the sec- tors overall with regard to (1) fishing boat design and safety; (2) improving and in some instances consolidating value chains, supply channels, diseases control and environmen- tal management within the full range of aquaculture options; (3) increase training of workers, restructuring and in some instances relocating fishing villages, strengthening fisheries inspection capacity; (4) improving management through co- management options partnering fishers and local communi- ties; (5) developing the research capacity and transfer of findings from it; (6) supporting market chains with improved analytical capacity of market demand trends, including that of importing countries.

This is a simplistic linear estimate with most of the increase potentially coming from marine aquaculture due to its present underdevelopment.

For freshwater aquaculture, integrated rice-fish culture has been demonstrated to produce two crops in the same space at the same time. Other benefits include reduced need for pesticides due to the fish consuming some insect pests and larvae. they derive their feed from residual nutrients in the paddy. about 10% of the pad- dy area is required for a fish sanctuary, commonly a trench along one side of the paddy and in some instances a deeper sump is also included. these areas serve as sanctuaries for fish when pesticide use is deemed neces- sary. Water levels are lowered: the fish migrate to the deeper areas: pesticide is used: and after about 48 hours when the pesticide has degraded, the fields are re-flooded. Evaluations have also shown that rice yields are not compromised due to the use of the area for fish habitat and actually have been found to be moderately increased by 3\u20134% or by 225 kg/ha/crop. Fish yields with stocking and no feeding are in the range of 550 kg/ha/year from documented experience in china. the fish derive their nutrition from residues in the fields. the culture of fresh- water prawns has also been conducted in rice fields in the mekong Delta but most often as an alternate crop. For brackish water aquaculture, coastal areas which lack water for rice cultivation in the dry season can be used for shrimp aquaculture during that period. Fields can be flooded with sea water and stocked with low den- sity shrimp seed with expected yields without feeding of about 250 kg/ha/season.

These areas are predominately fished by about 10,000 non-mechanized and roughly 60,000 low horsepower (>20 HP) vessels. A critical factor is to reduce the fishing through providing alternative livelihood opportunities to fish- ers who are interested while concurrently provid- ing education and vocational training to younger generations prior to their entering into the fishing business. Similarly, for offshore fisheries, efforts should be taken to reduce the fishing pressure and to properly management and exploit the stock so that endemic populations are allowed to develop for sustained, optimal economic benefit.

The main technical issues facing aquaculture are seed quality, disease control, feed supply and formulation, environmental impact man- agement and technology transfer. For seed quality, family selective breeding programs can be ex- panded upon with emphasis on indigenous species and means to control escapes of these genetically modified organisms or producing sterile seed for grow-out. Also, in some areas of the country, seed (fry and fingerlings) for aquaculture are not avail- able or not in sufficient quantities. The seed supply system needs to be strengthened through better coordination. One option would be for the Vietnam Fisheries Association (VINAFIS) to assist producers with connections to seed suppliers, particularly for favored species in the north such as tilapia that are in short supply and could benefit from hatcheries in the warmer climes of the south. Effluent and sludge management for reuse is a particular challenge to preclude environmental impacts due to the dis- charge of this pollution. Research needs to be done on how to best manage and reuse these nutrient by-products most likely via application to agricul- ture. Also, many aquaculture operations will need adjustments to their infrastructure, particularly as it relates to water supply and drainage systems. For feed, development of lower cost formula- tions can help with profitability for organisms that require feeds versus filter feeders or aquatic plants.

The models may vary by species and farming system. Marine aquaculture is the least developed form in the country, producing about 70,000 to 80,000 tons in 2011 or 2.4% of the total from aquaculture that year. Though considering the potential, there is considerable scope for its expansion, particularly via integrated marine aquaculture where filter feeding bivalve mollusks and seaweeds are cultured in close proximity to fish or lobster cage culture to enable feed wastes to be controlled through assimilation. In areas where water fertility is adequate, bivalve mollusks and/or seaweeds can be grown deriving their nutrition from the fertile waters. A system of water tenure would need to be further developed for interested households or compa- nies. Expansion should be done in an incremental manner with water quality monitoring. Marine aquaculture can also created areas protected from fishing allowing habitats for fisheries regeneration that would also contribute to restoring the marine catch. Brackish water aquaculture mainly involves shrimp farm- ing (indigenous Penaeus monodon and exotic Penaeus vannamei from the central eastern Pacific) reached about 400,000 tons in 2011. It is not anticipated that the cur- rent area or overall annual yields will increase very quickly due to risks of disease.

Freshwater aquaculture takes many forms that include pond, pen and cage culture of single species as well as fish polycultures that fully utilize he nutrient niches in the ponds. For pond aquaculture, integrated fishing farming with animal husbandry and agriculture where the wastes of each activities become nutrient for others is practiced in Vietnam as is rice/fish-or-freshwater prawn farming. Further expansion of these forms can help diversify food production structured to meet market demand. For integrated systems, greater resilience is feasible as markets fluctuate. Providing extension and training to farmers for broader application will require a long-term effort. For systems where fish or prawns are integrated into paddy fields, the yield of rice is little affected while pests can be controlled in part by the aquaculture and fertilizer use is also reduced. \u2022 Post-harvest and marketing.

Mekong, the granary of Vietnam, could lose in some simulations as much as 590,000 ha of rice area and combined with the yield impact, this could lead to a decline in rice production 2 to 7 M tons of rice per year if no adaptation is undertaken.

Fishery sector will be impacted but not damaged. Growth of fishery sector has contributed to the recent diversifica- tion of Vietnam agriculture. Aqua culture will certainly be challenged by CC as ponds are threatened by erosion and controlling salinity becomes more challenging as dry season fresh water flows are reduced and saline intrusion increases. Mekong Delta accounts for more than 70% of production. While increased flooding will increase habitat in the wet season there will be a reduction in dry season habitat and increased saline intrusion: these together would challenge current cat fish and shrimp farming operations, without necessarily a loss or perhaps even an increase in overall production, still requiring a major adaptation re- sponse (4/). Plantation forestry sector characterized by short duration rotations will feel the combined effect of rainfall variations and longer growing season. Average yields are expected to increase marginally but show a marked increase the vari- ability across various districts, with a possible decrease in the Mekong delta (4/). Livestock sector is likely to be confronted with more dis- ease problems. In tropical areas, especially the humid ones where thermoregulation through transpiration or panting is not very effective, high temperatures stress leads to hor- monal imbalances, which suppresses fertility. In the case of poultry, high temperatures lead to weak eggshells, a higher percentage of deformed eggs and increased mortality."

Indonesia\u2019s experience with Climate Schools (12/) has been positive for building awareness and capacity for rapid adaptation. conclusions In summary, this study recommends that Vietnam needs to: 1. Accelerate the uptake of well known and cur- rently practiced autonomous adaptation measures by farmers, to fully counter the impact of climate change projected to 2050, on yields and land avail- able for agriculture; 2. Exercise due caution and careful phasing when considering high cost public expenditures to build dykes and embankments to deal with slow, long term and uncertain threats of sea level rise; 3. Manage the potential negative social impacts on the poorer segments of the population through promoting diversification to higher value crops and promotion of non farm income opportunities, including appropriate payments for eco services provided by them and through crop and livestock insurance. 4.

Other aspects of infrastructure, especially those related to irrigation and drainage, drying yards, transport and logistical services, storage and processing such as warehouses, cold storages, sea ports, ICT, etc., are underdeveloped. Access to roads in rural areas is an ongoing problem, especially in rainy season when road deterioration is quite common. Many fishing har- bors and berths are overloaded and degraded.

Post-harvest losses remain high both in terms of quantity and quality. For example, high post harvest losses of 13\u201316% in rice are due to small scale, fragmented rice production leading to poor harvesting, drying, milling and storage system; poor paddy quality for milling and storage.

Around 2000, faced with increasing urban- ization and consumer demand for more diverse products in an expanding economy, the government of Vietnam started supporting a major growth of investment in the livestock sector. At this time some major direct foreign investments were also made in feed milling and livestock operations. Overall there was a major growth in livestock production from 2000\u20132010, from a combination of increasing animal numbers and productivity increase due to better feed and genetics. Nevertheless imports of livestock products and support for livestock development still grew fast during this period. Between 2000 and 2005, in response to increasing domestic demand by consumers, dairy imports increased in value from 307 million to 715 million USD. As animal production increased so did the need for animal feeds and thus the import of animal feed. From 2000\u20132010 animal feed imports grew in value from 597 million USD to 2160 million USD.

The provincial governments have been asked to set up public-private partnership based slaughterhouses, but the interest to use these is only limited.

Table A6.4 gives an overview of the pig numbers for 1995 till 2011 from statistics and 2012 till 2020 from the livestock development strategy: Besides the increasing number there has been an increas- ing share of modern genetics, so that the total biomass of these pigs is increasing faster than one would expect on the basis of only the animal numbers. This number of animals corresponds to a reported and predicted pork production as follows, again with maize equivalents calculated at a feed conversion of 2.25 and 60% maize in the feed (Table A6.5): The traditional Vietnamese pig sector has, besides the increase in numbers, gone through other major changes.

The more than 3 million households keeping pigs are however now at the maximum of what is feasible on their home plots without aggravating the environmental and animal disease problems. The next developmental steps will have to be specialization in either breeding piglets or fattening pigs. With the need to increase farm size to remain competitive the government will have to make land available for groups of pig producers to construct their pig farms away from the population centers. This will require land and capital, which are both scarce. In the future the role of the private sector in the pig sec- tor development will increase when the integrators start producing larger numbers of fattening weaners for farmers to rear till slaughter weight. It will also remove the need for farmers to produce their own piglets. The government built slaughterhouses are currently hardly been used.

That means that currently far less than 3% of the animals are slaughtered under veterinary control. It means that it is very difficult for official statistics to be gathered as most animals are slaughtered in the backyard and then transported by middlemen to the wet markets. The following calculations show what this means in terms of carcass weight, with 3 assumptions for extraction rate: there is unexplainable variation over the years, showing that there is a poor rela- tionship between the animal inventory and the amount of beef produced.

Given the excess production of rice for export there is scope to increase the area under maize at the expense of the area under rice to offset imports of maize if price levels provide that opportunity. A problem with the maize is that in the principal areas for maize production (e.g. Son la) the harvesting time coincides with the rainy season, which makes it necessary to mechanically dry the maize. It will require careful selection of hybrid maize varieties with grow- ing length up to maturity, which would fit in the crop rotation and preferably mature before the onset of the rains.

The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) in its Terrestrial Animal Health Code has recommen- dations on how this world animal health standard setting body sees the ideal veterinary services. This is with a Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) with if not the same status as a minister then at least the authorization to talk to the vari- ous ministers involved in the livestock sector (Industry and Trade, Public Health) and a single line of command all the way down to the veterinarians operating at village level. Unfortunately in many countries decentralizations have eroded this line of command. In Vietnam there is an ad- ditional particularity in that the People\u2019s Steering Committee on the advice of the government veterinarians will or will not declare the outbreak of a disease. Also the reports from the provincial veterinary services to the central level veterinary department are scrutinized by the Steering Committee.

It has led to better equipped diagnostic laboratories, a description of the various production sys- tems, and studies into the value chains and the hot spots for transmission. However, if it is politically not acceptable to impose strict movement rules and cull animals, if opera- 148 AgriculturAl trAnsformAtion & food security 2040\u2014VietnAm country report tional budgets are not sufficient to purchase the necessary equipment and consumables and contract/pay the required people for the field work then the investments will not resolve the problem. Therefore operational budgets of the veterinary services should assure their mobility, their com- munication and testing capacity. With the current structure of the livestock sector and consumer preference for fresh/hot meat and the low degree of slaughter under veterinary supervision it is difficult to put the measures in place with which the spread of diseases can be effectively controlled. Some 97 per cent of Viet Nam\u2019s 30,000 slaughterhouses are operating without the necessary paperwork, veterinary inspection and in residen- tial areas rather than in abattoirs away from the build-up areas according to the Department of Animal Health. The increased modernization of livestock keeping (e.g. no longer mixing ducks and chickens on the same farm, closed instead of open housing in poultry, specialization of pig farmers in breeders and fatteners) will create the conditions in the future with which it might be possible to control many livestock diseases better.

However to be able to export from a country either the country has to be free of these diseases or be di- vided in compartments, whereby some of those are disease free, after which there might be issued an export permit. Vietnam therefore has to make choices how to organize its veterinary services, whether it goes for a country-wide approach or starts to create disease free zones, from which the corporate agriculture sector can start to build up export based livestock production. Food saFety Currently ensuring food safety from on farm production up to consumption is split between MARD for production, Industry and Commerce for processing, storage and pack- aging and Ministry of Health for the effect of the products of animal origin on the consumers. There are as anywhere questions about the competence of each party in different segments of the value chain, areas that are undercovered and in general this system does not lead to sufficient assur- ance on the food safety control systems.

Vietnam has an increasing number of incidents of non-conformity with food safety standards and needs to take bold action to remedy this: the formation of a national food safety council with far stretching authority, also towards the ministries involved, is a step to be taken. A new law on Food Safety was gazetted on the 4th of July 2011. MARD is only mentioned in 1 article, whereas most food safety infringements are usually related to products of animal origin. Such a law should refer to the existing veterinary legislation to spell out what is expected from the veterinary services in terms of their contribution towards food safety assurance. Current ideas are to try to address deteriorating animal health and food safety problems through the introduction of a series of Good Animal Husbandry Practices (Viet GAHP16) designed address the specific conditions of livestock development in Vietnam. For example development (herd expansion) is to be mainly limited to take place in locations, which are distant from human centers where animals can optimally produce, where the environment is saved through the application of measures to process the waste and biosecurity can be maintained.

In addition, recent years have seen stagnating producer prices and increasing costs for livestock farmers leading to decreasing profit margins per animal. Livestock farmers are being increasingly forced to increase their num- bers of animals if they want to stay in business and improve on their management. Calculations from the CARD project17 showed that a smallholder in 2008 would need at least 8 sows to have a profitable pig breeding enterprise; this num- ber is bound to have increased during the last 4 years with the vast increases in stock feed and other prices.

The technical and financial challenges are such that sector representatives estimate is that in 2040 only around 10\u201312% of these farmers will still be pig farmers. In the other livestock sectors similar issues exist. The wave of the future will be the corporate farming sector, which is so far quite underdeveloped in Vietnam. Current estimates are that less than 5% of the aggregate livestock production comes from the corporate farming sector.

This means that there is tremendous interest from foreign investors to become part of this growth. Modern retail channels, be it supermarkets or fast-food chains, will play a major role in future growth and will determine increasingly what type of a product is required. Also in Vietnam the working middleclass needs convenience and cannot afford to trek every day to the wet markets to purchase its meat, fruit and vegetables. Also the better-informed consumers realize that street vending and wet markets do not have the conditions to deliver a hygienic product. There are currently 636 supermarkets, 120 commercial centers and over 1000 convenience stores according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. This still does not seem to fulfill the demand.

The technology to process manure and straw, even using worms such as Californian tiger worms to speed up the process has to be developed, extended and promoted. The continuous maize production on the sloping lands in the North is leading to erosion, in some places already severe erosion. Most of these areas are inhabited by ethnic minorities. The maize cultivation should be strongly embed- ded in a farming system of ruminant production, whereby the soil on the slopes if not through terracing then at least through grass strips is stabilized and farmers can use maize stover and cut grass from the anti-erosion strips to feed their livestock. Through these interventions the increase in numbers of ruminants through the close combination and integration with crop production is feasible. Strategic low-cost supplementation with a urea-molasses-minerals mix should improve the efficiency of the animals to utilize these high fiber diets.

FDI rose from $147 billion in 2017 to $155 billion, with four Member States reaching new records (Cambodia, Indonesia, Singapore and Viet Nam).

Most of the increase was due to rising inflows from the European Union, Japan, Hong Kong (China), India and the Republic of Korea. The expansion was accompanied by a further increase in cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) after the jump in 2017. XVIII ASEAN Investment Report 2019 \u2013 FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care The rise in manufacturing FDI was widespread across ASEAN Member States. The majority went to Singapore, Indonesia, Viet Nam and Thailand. The growth was part of the gradual shift of production capacity from China and elsewhere to ASEAN, caused by structural factors (the increase in relative labour costs in China) and accelerated by the United States\u2013 China trade tensions. Despite a 3 per cent drop, intra-ASEAN investment ($25 billion in 2018) was still the largest source of FDI, accounting for 16 per cent of inflows. However, this includes some investment originating outside ASEAN that was channelled through Singapore. Singapore remained the largest regional investor and Indonesia the largest recipient of such investment. Combined FDI flows to the CLMV countries rose by 4 per cent in 2018, to a record level of $23 billion, representing 15 per cent of flows into ASEAN.

This was in line with the global fall in United States investment due to the 2017 tax reforms. The FDI fall in ASEAN was concentrated in Singapore, where United States investment fell from $28 billion in 2017 to just $4 billion in 2018. However, United States FDI in manufacturing activities in ASEAN reversed from -$1.2 billion in 2017 to $12.4 billion, with significant increases in Indonesia and Thailand. Governments in ASEAN are encouraging the adoption of fourth industrial revolution technologies (e.g. industrial robots, artificial intelligence, data analytics, additive manufac- turing technologies) in industry, and promoting investment by start-ups and producers of relevant technologies.

The private equity and venture capital markets in the region are growing. Combined assets under management rose by 8.6 per cent, from $26 billion in 2017 to $28 billion in 2018. These funds support the growth of start-ups in the region, building future ASEAN MNEs. Governments across ASEAN have introduced initiatives to support the growth of start-ups and to foster investment, including by providing public-private co-investment opportunities and tax incentives. FDI into ASEAN is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by progress in regional integration, dynamic industrial development with new growth opportunities from production links with and shifts in production from China, and the improving regional investment environment. MNEs from many countries (e.g. Australia, Japan and the United States, as well as some from the European"

The share of services in total FDI in the region grew from 50 per cent in 1999\u20132003 to 66 per cent in 2014\u20132018, in line with the global average, but much higher than the share of services in regional GDP (50 per cent). Such FDI rose from an annual average of $12 billion in 1999-2003 to $88 billion in 2014\u20132018 (figure 3) due to increasing investment in financial services, wholesale and retail, and real estate.

This includes investment in holding companies, back-office activities, regional headquarters activities and distribution functions, which may support industrial activities throughout ASEAN but are classified as services FDI. The implication is that most FDI in other ASEAN Member States is in manufacturing. Services activities accounted for nearly three-quarters of M&As in ASEAN in 2014\u20132018. Cross-border M&As in services rose to a total of $43 billion in 2014\u20132018, from just $16 billion in 2009\u20132013.

Many global retailers, such as Aeon (Japan), Alibaba (China), Amazon (United States), Carrefour (France), Lawson (Japan), Seven & I Holdings (Japan), Tesco (United Kingdom), Walmart (United States) are present in ASEAN, and they continue to expand regionally. New start-ups have also emerged in the retail industry, using technology to venture into the e-commerce space, contributing to the increase in retail activities. The 50 most- funded e-commerce start-ups in ASEAN had raised $12.6 billion as of July 2019, with most of the funding raised in the last two years. Many have raised venture capital to scale up operations and invest in other ASEAN Member States. Logistics FDI in the logistics sector appears small.

There are several options for promoting more investment in the sector, including promoting logistics start-ups that serve niche markets (especially in last-mile delivery) and digital technology companies. *** The prospects for more FDI in services (financial, retail and logistics) in ASEAN are promising, with the rapid rise in trade volumes and industrial activity, improvements in logistics facilities and the growth of e-commerce. Growth will also be supported by regional agreements signed recently, and the implementation of the programmes of the AEC Blueprint 2025.

XXII ASEAN Investment Report 2019 \u2013 FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care INVESTMENT, PLAYERS AND POLICY OPTIONS IN HEALTH CARE Health care demand in ASEAN, and the need for investment in the regional health care market, will increase rapidly in the coming years. This increase is driven by population growth, changing demographics, universal health care programmes and the rise in the incidence of non-communicable diseases. Currently, health care expenditure in ASEAN accounts for 4 per cent of the region\u2019s GDP, well below the global average of 10 per cent, and is expected to grow. In 2016, health care expenditure in ASEAN was $99 billion, equivalent to 1.3 per cent of the world\u2019s health care expenditure. By 2025, it is expected to reach about $270 billion, more than the projected size of the region\u2019s fast-growing internet economy ($240 billion by 2025).

Complexities in regulations and administrative procedures for investors affect all industries. However, they can be more of a constraint for firms that are relatively new to international expansion and for small and medium-sized enterprises \u2013 both of which are common in health care. (ii) Differences in health care industry standards and regulations across ASEAN. The need for international investors in the industry to adapt to and comply with multiple regulatory systems to operate in the region adds complexity and increases costs. (iii) Skills shortages and technology weaknesses. The limited availability of doctors and skilled health care workers continues to weigh on the development of the health care industry across the region. The findings in this report highlight health care development priorities and possible investment policy initiatives. They include: (i) Universal access. This priority drives the need for more investment in hospitals; the complementary role of private investment, including through public-private partnerships; and the necessity to make the industry a priority for investment promotion agencies and to step up investment facilitation efforts. (ii) Affordable high-quality care. This priority drives the need to balance the development of private health care with appropriate regulation, to target the promotion of private investment selectively and to safeguard competition to keep prices in check.

It also implies incentivizing and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises and venture capital firms; promoting local ownership and local start-ups; and providing support for innovation, medical tourism and services exports. Medical tourism is an important mechanism through which development benefits can be gained.

This fall in United States investment was global. The tax reforms introduced in late 2017 encouraged many American MNEs to move profits retained in their foreign subsidiaries, holding companies or regional headquarters back to the home country (UNCTAD 2018, WIR 2019). In Singapore, the drop in United States FDI was significant, from $28 billion in 2017 to just $4 billion last year. United States MNEs in financial services divested -$11 billion in 2018 (from $24 billion in 2017). However, United States investment in manufacturing increased, especially in Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. 1.2.3. FDI by sector and industry Strong FDI into the manufacturing sector (figure 1.10a) and three major services industries (finance, wholesale and retail trade, and real estate) (figure 1.10b) contributed to the record inflows in 2018 (annex table 1.1). They together received $130 billion in investment or some 85 per cent of total inflows in the region. There were important changes in the industrial investment pattern in 2018. FDI in the manufacturing sector rose significantly, while investment in the three major services industries (finance, wholesale and retail, and real estate) was mixed.

MNEs from ASEAN also divested (-$836 million). Most of the divestment took place in Indonesia. For instance, PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Indonesia) acquired a 40 per cent stake in Grasberg Mine from Rio Tinto (United Kingdom) for $3.5 billion and PTT Exploration & Production (Thailand) acquired a 22 per cent stake from Shell (Netherlands) for the Bongkot offshore gas field in Thailand, a joint project of the two companies, for $750 million. Manufacturing sector The manufacturing sector witnessed a significant jump in FDI, with inflows rising from $30 billion in 2017 to a record level of $55 billion in 2018. Manufacturing FDI accounted for 35 per cent of total inflows in the region, which contrasted with only 21 per cent in 2017. Most ASEAN Member States saw an increase in manufacturing FDI; much of it went to Singapore, Indonesia, Viet Nam and Thailand. The United States ($12 billion), Japan ($10 billion), intra-ASEAN investment ($8 billion), the EU ($7 billion), Hong Kong (China) ($3 billion) and the Republic of Korea ($2 billion) were the six largest sources of manufacturing FDI in 2018.

The structural driver is the steady increase in relative labour costs in China, and now that shift has accelerated as a result of the effect of the United States-China trade tensions. The main beneficiaries in terms of manufacturing FDI include Indonesia, Thailand and the CLMV countries. There has been an increase in cases of foreign and Chinese companies establishing or shifting operations from China to ASEAN because of these reasons,7 with more firms planning to follow suit.8 More than one-third of the 430 United States companies in China surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce China and the American Chamber of Commerce Shanghai have moved or are considering moving production bases elsewhere to mitigate the effects of the higher tariffs, with 18.5 per cent planning to move to Southeast Asia (AmCham China and AmCham Shanghai 2018). Tech companies have already made such moves.

More than 80 per cent of FDI in finance in ASEAN last year went to Singapore. A significant part of that investment may be used to fund FDI activities throughout the region, given the importance of regional headquarters functions in Singapore. FDI in the wholesale and retail industry in ASEAN fell by more than $6 billion to $20 billion in 2018, despite increased investments from Japanese, Chinese and ASEAN MNEs (chapter 2). The fall was due to a -$9 billion divestment by United States firms (mostly funds repatriation), which had invested $4 billion in 2017.

Despite the decline, intraregional investment remained at a high level compared with the historical trend and is still the largest source of investment for the region. In addition to Indonesia, the CLMV countries continued to receive increasing attention from ASEAN companies. Regional integration, investment opportunities and the expansion of corporate activities continued to drive the growth of intra-ASEAN investments. Some large ASEAN companies continued to expand regionally with investment into multiple ASEAN Member States in 2018 and 2019. They include Axiata, Maybank and Leong Hup International (all Malaysia); Ayala, Pilmico Foods Corporation, San Miguel and Jollibee (all Philippines); Central Group, CP Foods, Gogoprint and Siam Cement (all Thailand); and Golden Agri-Resources, Grab, Keppel and Wilmar (all Singapore). ASEAN start-ups are also contributing to intra-ASEAN investments through their internationalization and success in fundraising to expand in the region. Intra-ASEAN investment is inflated by investments originating from outside the region channelled through Singapore. Excluding such conduit flows, the share of intra-regional stock drops by about one fifth (WIR 2019).

More than 230 global institutional investors are targeting the ASEAN region, with the vast majority aiming to invest in venture capital funds, growth funds and buyout funds. Intraregional investment accounts for 24 per cent of total investments into ASEAN-focused venture capital funds. Singapore is the largest source (48 per cent), followed by Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines (figure 1.21). In terms of industry focus, the top three sectors most favoured by investors are technology (83 per cent of investors), health care (65 per cent) and consumer services (62 per cent). *** Governments across ASEAN are integral to the rise of the private equity and venture capital industry in the region. They have introduced initiatives to support the growth of start-ups and foster investment in collaborative environments. For example, Singapore\u2019s Startup SG initiative offers co-investment opportunities and tax incentives to encourage private sector funding. Indonesia launched the NextICorn Foundation to showcase the government\u2019s commitment to facilitate start-ups in its domestic digital ecosystem. These two countries are home to six unicorns between them, the most in ASEAN. The Malaysian government established the Malaysia Innovation Policy Council to support digital tech initiatives in the private sector.

PROSPECTS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS MNEs and ASEAN companies continued to invest and expand in the region in a broad range of industries in 2018. Their investment and expansion activities helped push up FDI flows in ASEAN to an all-time high. A significant jump in manufacturing FDI and strong investment flows to financial services contributed to the rise. Active M&A activities in the region by MNEs and ASEAN companies have also help pushed up FDI flows last year. Even before the recent trade tensions and the shift in production, MNEs had been investing and expanding in the region to meet growing demand, upgrade in value chains (e.g. into R&D and retailing functions to support manufacturing) and join regional production networks (AIR 2014). MNEs from within and outside the ASEAN region will remain active investors, driven by their growing interest to strengthen regional footholds, take advantage of emerging regional Figure 1.21.

Many United States corporate executives with business in ASEAN expect their companies to increase investment in the region in the next five years (Amcham Singapore and United States Chamber of Commerce 2018). ASEAN is increasingly seen as an important market for United States MNEs in terms of worldwide revenue (Amcham Singapore and United States Chamber of Commerce 2019). Similarly, many European companies are also planning to expand their operations in ASEAN over the next five years (EU-ASEAN Business Council 2018). Japanese and Australian companies also have expansion plans in the region (JETRO 2018; Australia- ASEAN Chamber of Commerce 2019). MNEs surveyed in these and other studies perceive ASEAN as a region with high potential and an attractive location for investment. The factors include the rapid growth of the middle class, an integrating region of more than 650 million people, an improving investment environment, with commitment to infrastructure development and complementary location advantages that support regional value chain activities. The region is also witnessing rapid growth in several key industries, such as the automotive, electronics and retail businesses, and in the digital economy. Indeed, 85 per cent of European firms responding to the EU-ASEAN 2018 business survey see further ASEAN economic integration as an important consideration in their business success in the region. Manufacturing activities and the three major services industries (finance, wholesale and retail, and real estate) will continue to receive significant share of FDI flows \u2013 similar to the pattern witnessed in 2018. However, the Chinese government\u2019s policy in curbing outward OFDI in real estate will have implications for Chinese real estate investment in ASEAN in 2019.

INTRODUCTION The services sector is the largest recipient of FDI in ASEAN and FDI in services in the region is rising. Building on AIR 2018 on the digital economy, this chapter looks at those services industries that are important for digital development (e.g. fintech, payment systems, e-readiness). 2.2. FDI IN SERVICES FDI in services rose from an annual average of $12 billion in 1999\u20132003 to $88 billion in 2014\u2013 2018. The sector accounted for two-thirds of FDI flows in ASEAN in 2014\u20132018 (figure 2.1), in line with the global average, but much higher than the share of services in regional GDP (50 per cent).

FDI in services by destination The composition of services FDI in 2014\u20132018 varies widely across ASEAN. Singapore remained the largest recipient of services FDI throughout the period, with more than 70 per cent share (table 2.3). The high share of services FDI in Singapore is due to its role as a regional investment hub and its hosting of many holding companies, back-office activities, regional headquarters activities and distribution functions, which are classified as services FDI (UNCTAD 2017). Much of this investment flows through Singapore and is subsequently invested elsewhere in the region, including in industrial (non-services) activities.

Brunei Darussalam FDI in services in 2014\u20132018 was mostly accounted for by inflows into the construction industry. A number of major projects started construction during this period. They include the $1.6 billion 30-kilometer cross-sea Temburong bridge, which started construction in 2014 and is expected to open in 2020. Investors in the project include China State Construction Engineering Corporation and Daelim (Republic of Korea). The ongoing construction of a major crude oil refinery and petrochemical plant, which started in 2017, is another major activity. 65 Chapter 2 FDI in Services This FDI project is a joint venture between Hengyi Industries (China) and the Government of Brunei Darussalam. Cambodia A series of investment activities in banking boosted services FDI in 2016 and 2017. They include the acquisition of an additional equity stake in Prasac Microfinance Institution by a foreign investor group, the acquisition of a 40 per cent stake in Phnom Penh Commercial Bank by Jeonbuk Bank (Republic of Korea) and the acquisition of an additional equity stake in Advanced Bank of Asia by National Bank of Canada. The rapid growth of the Cambodian economy has also attracted considerable real estate activities in recent years.

The Cirebon power station, for instance, was developed by a joint venture between four companies: Marubeni Corporation (Japan), Korea Midland Power (Republic of Korea), Samtan (Republic of Korea) and PT Indika Energy (Indonesia). In 2018, Power Construction Corporation (China) signed an agreement to develop five hydropower facilities in North Kalimantan, with an estimated investment of $17.8 billion. Power projects in the country have also attracted foreign MNEs, to provide engineering, procurement and construction services. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic Electricity is the country\u2019s major export, and FDI has played a major role in power generation in the country. Foreign investors have been actively involved in generating power for sale to the host country and for export to their home or neighbouring markets (section 1.3). For example, Ratch Group (Thailand) and Banpu Power (Thailand) have equity stakes in Hongsa Power Company, which operates a coal-fired power station in Xaignabouri. In 2017, Mega First Corporation (Malaysia) participated in the construction of the 260 MW Don Sahong hydropower plant. In 2018, Norinco International Cooperation (China) commissioned the 86 MW Nam Phay hydropower plant. It owns 85 per cent, and the remaining 15 per cent is owned by \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Lao (Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic). Impact Energy Asia (Thailand) is developing Monsoon Wind Power, a $1.3 billion 600 MW wind farm project, the largest in ASEAN.

Financial services were the main target. Business activities emerged as the single largest services industry for M&A activities (40 per cent), largely due to a single deal (the $12 billion acquisition of Global Logistic Properties (Singapore) by Nesta Investment (China) in 2018). The value of M&As in transport and storage (logistics) was subdued in 2009\u20132013 due to divestments (acquisitions of foreign-owned assets by indigenous companies) but rose markedly in 2014\u20132018, to $8.2 billion. Large deals such as the acquisition of Neptune Orient (Singapore) by CMA (France) for $2.4 billion in 2016 pushed up M&A sales in this industry.

For instance, CP (Thailand) acquired a 64 per cent interest in supermarket operator Siam Makro (Thailand) from SHV Holdings (Netherlands) for $4.2 billion in 2013.

DETERMINANTS AND MOTIVATIONS OF FDI IN SERVICES FDI by MNEs in services industries can be influenced by different determinants and economic considerations (table 2.5). A majority of FDI in services is motivated by market-seeking factors (e.g. market size, the growing number of middle-income consumers, economic growth and the benefits of regional integration) (Dunning 2003; Wadhwa and Reddy 2011; Zheng and Ismail 2019). These factors have been cited by services MNEs as reasons for investing in the region (AIR 2018, chapter 1). FDI in services may be driven by efficiency-seeking considerations (to lower costs of labour, overhead and administration) such as in information technology and business process outsourcing (IT-BPO). Some services MNEs have also expanded in ASEAN for a combination of efficiency-seeking and strategic reasons, such as to establish regional headquarters and to conduct R&D.

Market-seeking FDI The large market of 650 million people in ASEAN, with a combined GDP of $3 trillion in 2018, is a major determinant in MNEs\u2019 decisions to invest. ASEAN is today the seventh-largest economy in the world, and by 2030 it is expected to be the fourth largest after the EU, the United States and China. This growing market potential has encouraged many MNEs to expand their operations in ASEAN in a wide range of services industries such as finance, banking, retailing, and information and communication technology, as well as in the digital economy. ASEAN has also established free trade agreement arrangements with a number of partner economies, which include Australia, China, India and New Zealand \u2013 offering MNEs a larger market. Regional integration has increasingly become an important factor for FDI in ASEAN. This is because it creates a bigger market, opens up services industries to foreign investment, and promotes liberalization and harmonization of standards and qualifications that facilitate cross- border operations. A key determinant is the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), with its end goal of a single market and production base characterized by seamless movement of goods, services, investments, capital and skilled labour. Other barriers to trade, investment and services continue to be eliminated. Significant achievements in market liberalization and facilitation have been attained through the implementation of the AEC Blueprint 2015. In 2015, ASEAN formally declared the establishment of the AEC. In moving forward, the region has continued to implement major economic agreements, more trade and investment liberalization and facilitation measures, and sectoral programmes to further strengthen integration so as to achieve the end goal of the AEC: a more closely connected ASEAN.

ASEAN\u2019s regional integration has led to a progressive liberalization of services industries, improvements in the investment environment and increases in the transparency and efficiency of policies for businesses and FDI. Increasingly, MNEs and ASEAN companies have been adopting a regional strategy rather than independent country investment programmes (AIR 2018, chapter 1). The economic growth in ASEAN has attracted new MNEs to invest in the region and existing ones to expand and diversify operations. Some banks have diversified their services or expanded the spectrum of the value chain to offer wealth management services to the growing upper-middle-class population. Many insurance companies with a long-standing presence in ASEAN have also diversified their services coverage, including their geographical reach in the region. Driven by the large market potential, many retail and logistics MNEs have also actively invested in the region (sections 2.5 and 2.6). 72 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 \u2013 FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care The digital or internet economy in the region is growing rapidly.

Infrastructure investment needs in ASEAN are huge, estimated to be at least $110 billion per year through 2025 (AIR 2015). Infrastructure development in ASEAN has attracted the participation of many Asian, European and United States MNEs. For example, Tokyo Electric Power (Japan) invested in Viet Hydro (Viet Nam) in 2018 to grow its overseas business in hydropower projects.6 A partnership between China\u2019s Huaneng Hydrolancang International Energy (51 per cent), Cambodia\u2019s Royal Group (39 per cent) and Viet Nam\u2019s EVN International (10 per cent) began developing Cambodia\u2019s largest hydropower project.7 China\u2019s General Nuclear Power Group acquired Malaysian energy company Edra Global Energy in 2016. Infrastructure development in power and transportation (including airports and ports) has attracted many related services companies to establish a presence in ASEAN to be near the centre of development and to win contracts. Some services companies need to operate close to major customers such as those in power project development, mining, and oil and gas activities.

The expansion of Samsung (Republic of Korea) in Viet Nam has encouraged many of its suppliers and service providers to follow the MNE to that country.

A study of 60 economies (including Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Viet Nam) found that reducing FDI restrictions by 10 per cent could increase bilateral FDI stocks by 2.1 per cent on average (Mistura and Roulet 2019). In addition to regional liberalization measures, the ASEAN Member States have also undertaken unilateral reform or further opening-up of industries for FDI, including in the services sector. Some of these reforms include amendments of investment-related domestic legislation, with the objective of creating more coherent legal frameworks for investment. Foreign and domestic investment laws are now unified in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam (OECD 2019). Countries in the region have also further improved business procedures, enhanced transparency and reduced the time needed for registration by using digital means of registration (Box and Lopez-Gonzalez 2017).

The BPO processes are usually standardized, which means that BPO MNEs can provide back-office support to other MNEs in ASEAN and around the world. Because of the availability of language skills and low-cost skilled labour for IT-BPO operations, the Philippines has attracted many such MNEs. Australian IT-BPO companies have invested in the country to supply BPO services, including call centre operations (AIR 2018). American and European MNEs have also established IT-BPO operations in the Philippines. Some Australian firms, such as QBE Insurance Group and the BHP Group, have established subsidiaries in the country to serve clients in their group. Citibank (United States), JPMorgan (United States) and other large foreign banks have back-office operations in the Philippines. These companies are also moving up the value chain in the BPO business by shifting from voice operations (call centres) into more complex activities and data analysis.

For instance, the acquisition by Alibaba (China) of Lazada in Singapore supports expansion in ASEAN through immediate access to Lazada\u2019s market networks in the region. The acquisition by Mitsubishi UFG Financial Group (MUFG) (Japan) of a majority stake in Bank of Ayudhya (Thailand) provided immediate access to its networks and customers. Some Korean banks (e.g. Jeonbuk Bank and Shinhan Bank) have recently acquired banks in Cambodia and Viet Nam for strategic-asset-seeking reasons. Pilmico Foods Corporation (Philippines) acquired a 75 per cent stake in one of the largest agribusiness MNEs in ASEAN (Gold Coin Management Holdings (British Virgin Islands)), which provides Pilmico with immediate access to 20 livestock and aqua feed mills across 11 economies in Asia. In logistics, Kintetsu World Express (Japan) acquired APL Logistics in Singapore to gain access to its networks and regional facilities. 75 Chapter 2 FDI in Services Resource-seeking FDI FDI in services also involves resource-seeking motives such as backward integration or expansion of segments of the value chain. An example is electricity companies accessing resources (e.g. hydropower and coal) to generate electricity for sale to local markets or for export to their home market (e.g. a Thai electricity company generating electricity in another country for export to Thailand). Thai companies Ch.Kanchang, Electricity Generating, Natee Synergy and Bangkok Expressway are investors in a power plant in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic that generates energy for export back to Thailand. 2.4. FDI AND MNEs IN FINANCIAL SERVICES The financial industry plays an important role in the industrial development and services sector in ASEAN. Foreign and ASEAN banks are present and expanding in the region. Many foreign MNEs have established holding companies in the region (mostly in Singapore) to own, coordinate or manage subsidiaries in the Asia-Pacific"

Although these companies do not produce goods and services, their regional coordination and corporate ownership functions have a significant influence on FDI flows in the host countries. 2.4.1. FDI in financial services FDI in financial services in ASEAN has fluctuated over the past two decades but shown an upward trend (figure 2.2). The annual average FDI in the industry more than tripled during that period, from $11 billion in 2001\u20132007 to $36 billion in 2012\u20132018 (figure 2.3). However, the share of the industry in total FDI remained stable at 29 per cent in both periods. Figure 2.2.

In 2009, following the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis, FDI in financial services plummeted to just $827 million \u2013 the lowest amount on record. Recovering from the European debt crisis in the early 2010s, FDI in financial services peaked in 2016 at $44 billion. In 2018, it fell marginally to $42 billion. M&A megadeals in some years (e.g. 2014 and 2018) also affected the trend because of the lumpiness of such transactions. Some foreign banks have divested assets, which were bought by local banks, also contributing to the fluctuating flows. This trend was consistent with the scaling down by many large EU and United States banks of operations abroad to restructure and manage risks after the 2007\u20132008 global financial crisis.

In 2012\u20132018, the financial industry accounted for 30 per cent of M&As in the region and was the second largest target after business services (which consisted mostly of real estate). Given the strategic nature of financial and banking businesses, M&As are a preferred choice for market entry, especially for consumer banking activities, because they provide immediate access to established banking networks, branches and consumer bases. M&As in financial activities spiked in 2013 because of megadeals by MUFG (Japan), which involved a $5.3 billion acquisition of a majority stake in Bank of Ayudhya in Thailand, and by Sumitomo Mitsui (Japan), with a $949 million acquisition of Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional (Indonesia).

Home-grown banks are also acquiring the banking assets of foreign banks in ASEAN. In 2016, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (Singapore) acquired the Singapore wealth and investment management business of Barclays Bank (United Kingdom) for $320 million.

DBS Bank (Singapore) acquired the wealth management and retail banking business of Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (Australia) in 2017 for $79 million. 2.4.3. Banking industry specifics Some key features of the banking industry in ASEAN merit highlighting because of their implications for investment. Underserved population ASEAN is still relatively underserved by banks (figure 2.5), especially in the CLMV countries. Some 73 per cent of the region\u2019s population does not have a bank account (KPMG 2016). Consumers in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam continue to rely on cash to pay for their goods. About 78 per cent of the adult population in Cambodia, 50 per cent in Indonesia, 66 per cent in the Philippines and 18 per cent in Thailand did not have a bank account in 2017. The size of the underserved banking segment suggests that there is scope for investment in banking, including the use of technology to reach the unserved in the region. 78 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 \u2013 FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Mobile"

It is over 100 per cent for Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam, as some mobile phone users own more than one SIM card (Khidhir 2018). The scale of phone penetration also explains the increase in fintech investment in the region (section 2.4.5). Fintech development New types of service providers, particularly fintech companies, have emerged to compete with traditional service providers in offering financial services and solutions to customers, including payment solutions, loan applications, money transfers and remittances as well as robo-advisory and personal financial management services. Fintech companies can respond more quickly to changes in consumer demand and behaviour than traditional banks because they tend to focus on process rather than product innovation. Major banks and other corporations in the region are also investing in fintech by developing dedicated divisions and acquiring fintech companies or as corporate venture capital entities. 2.4.4. Multinational banks in ASEAN Regional growth, investment opportunities and saturated home markets are driving foreign banks to invest in ASEAN. MNEs from Japan have been actively expanding in the region to counter the low demand for credit at home. The significant presence of Japanese manufacturing companies in ASEAN has also encouraged Japanese banks to expand in the region. Similarly, Korean banks are increasing their regional presence because of the region\u2019s market potential and the crowded market at home. For example, in 2016 Busan Bank opened Figure 2.5.

European and American banks were the earliest to establish a presence in the region. Banks from the United States, such as Citibank, have been in the region for over a century.

These banks include Bangkok Bank (Thailand), CIMB (Malaysia), DBS (Singapore), Maybank (Malaysia) and UOB (Singapore), all of which are present in multiple locations in ASEAN. Although Thai banks are not as internationalized as Malaysian and Singaporean banks, recently many have expanded to other ASEAN Member States, predominantly to serve their home clients overseas.11 Some banks, such as the UOB (Singapore), provide FDI advisory services to clients and are involved with fintech as well as venture capital funding for start-ups in the region (box 2.1)."

Most of this funding was raised in recent years, with about $1 billion or 60 per cent raised between January 2018 and August 2019 (annex table 2.3). A majority of the 50 most-funded ASEAN fintech start-ups operate in the payments and remittance solution segment and are engaged in lending, loans and credit. The other types of solutions provided by these fintech start-ups are financial exchange, investment tools and platforms, financial product comparisons, financial accounting and administration services. With a large and growing demand for such services, Indonesia is witnessing an increase in the number of fintech companies and start-ups. These start-ups are able to exploit niche markets that traditional financial services companies have been unable to serve. Although most of the top 50 fintech start-ups also serve customers in other ASEAN economies, only 42 per cent maintain a physical presence abroad (AIR 2018). Examples of those with a physical presence abroad include InvestorZ (Thailand) in Singapore, Acudeen Technologies (Philippines) in Myanmar, Omise (Thailand) in Indonesia and Singapore, and Coin.ph (Philippines) in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.

FDI AND MNEs IN WHOLESALE AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES FDI in wholesale and retail is market-seeking oriented, entering markets with potential for growth. One study estimated retail sales in just four ASEAN Member States (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand) to be $1 trillion in 2018.17 Sales are set to grow further with the increasing population. Although \u201cwet\u201d markets and family-owned shops are still the mainstay of the retail industry, the increasingly consumerist lifestyle in ASEAN is creating a market for modern retail chains, not only supermarkets and convenience stores but also luxury brand outlets. 2.5.1. FDI trends and pattern in wholesale and retail In 2012\u20132018, FDI flows to the wholesale and retail industry18 in ASEAN amounted to an annual average of $29 billion or 16 per cent of total FDI inflows (or 24 per cent of services FDI). About 70 per cent of these flows went to Singapore. Indonesia accounted for 18 per cent, followed by Thailand and Viet Nam, with 4 per cent each. A majority of the FDI in this industry in Singapore was in the wholesale trade, as MNEs or Singapore-based wholesalers operated regional logistics hubs and coordinated purchases from that country.

This section focuses on FDI in the retail industry, an intensely competitive industry in which major foreign MNEs have entered (and sometimes exited) the ASEAN market in recent years. M&A transactions in wholesale and retail in 2012\u20132018 were worth $18 billion, of which more than 80 per cent involved acquisitions in retail. Another reason to focus on retail is its impact on host economies. The retail industry has been the largest source of employment in ASEAN (Chang, Rynhart and Huynh 2016). Some 45 million people, or 16 per cent of the region\u2019s employment, work in this industry. FDI into the wholesale and retail industry has fluctuated over the last seven years (figure 2.8). In 2012, ASEAN attracted $38 billion of such FDI, but in 2013 the volume fell to $17 billion. This was partially because of acquisitions of foreign-owned assets in the region by local retailers. Divestment by MNEs from the Netherlands and acquisitions of foreign assets by local companies led to the drop in 2015. The fall in 2018, from $26 billion in 2017 to $20 billion, can be explained by a -$8.9 billion divestment from the United States, traditionally a significant investor in this industry. 87 Chapter 2 FDI in Services The major investors are from the EU, the United States, Japan, China and intra-ASEAN sources (figure 2.9). These five contributed nearly 70 per cent of FDI to the industry. Although FDI from most major economies into this industry has fluctuated over the years, intra-ASEAN investment has risen steadily since 2012 as ASEAN retailers have expanded in the region.

ASEAN retailers are expanding not only regionally but also domestically through acquisitions of the assets of foreign retailers (table 2.8). This phenomenon explains the increase in the levels of divestment in the industry in 2012\u20132018.

Efficient logistics services are thus important. Domestic logistics providers in the region tend to be small businesses that may not be the most cost-efficient owing to their lack of scale. Nor do these businesses necessarily have the capabilities to handle cross-border logistics, as they tend to be oriented to the domestic- market (Tham and Basu-Das 2017). The need for more efficient cross-border logistics services, lower logistics costs and new logistics requirements in e-commerce and the ability to meet increasing demand all present market-seeking opportunities for investors in the region. In places where local logistics companies are small and fragmented, international logistics companies have entered the market, targeting especially export-oriented businesses. APL Logistics (United States), DSV (Denmark), Panalpina (Switzerland) and Yusen Logistics (Japan) have established operations across ASEAN to serve export-oriented manufacturers. They provide a broad range of services, such as cross-dock handling, inland transportation, warehousing and distribution management, and customs clearance. Some foreign companies are following their industrial customers from their home country to ASEAN.

One megadeal, the $2.4 billion acquisition of Neptune Orient Lines (Singapore) in 2016 by Merit Corporation (Lebanon), significantly pushed up the value of cross-border M&As in the region that year. In 2017\u20132018, however, the number of cross-border M&As dropped notably as more local companies acquired foreign-owned logistics entities. Some examples of such M&A transactions: BTS Group (Thailand) acquired a 23 per cent stake in the Thai operations of Kerry Express (Hong Kong, China), Thai Beverage (Thailand) acquired a 75 per cent equity interest in Havi Logistics (Thailand) from the Havi Group (United States), Tasco (Malaysia) acquired Meriah Selalu in Malaysia from Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (Japan), and SM Investments Figure 2.14.

The top 50 have a significant presence in five ASEAN Member States (Singapore, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia) (figure 2.16). Almost all of them have a presence in Singapore because of that country\u2019s status as an international logistics hub. There are fewer international logistics companies in Brunei Darussalam and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic because of their smaller markets. International logistics companies can also serve these markets through logistic networks with partners that already have a presence in these countries. The availability of efficient infrastructure facilities and significant volumes of business are important investment considerations.

Improving investment environment and liberalization The investment environment in the region is improving further with regional integration, increased industrial activity, economic growth and market liberalization. ASEAN Member States have taken national actions and under the AFAS are further opening the logistics industry for investment, with additional relaxations of foreign equity ownership restrictions (table 2.9). Rapid rise in trade volumes Trade volumes in the region have risen rapidly, from $0.8 trillion in 2000 to $2.9 trillion in 2018 (figure 2.17). This trend is expected to continue. Strong trade activity will drive more investment in logistics services to meet demand. Improving infrastructure facilities and increasing logistics efficiency As a result of improving infrastructure development from more investment (AmCham Singapore and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 2019) and the entrance of more logistics companies, logistics services in ASEAN Member States have become more efficient. Improving infrastructure plays an important role in attracting logistics investment. Rise of e-commerce The region is witnessing a rapid rise in e-commerce and internet-based business activity.

CONCLUSION The services sector is the largest recipient of FDI in ASEAN, accounting for two-thirds of all FDI flows in 2014\u20132018. That share will continue to grow as economies in the region become more service oriented. Nearly 80 per cent went to three industries: financial services, wholesale and retail, and real estate. FDI into these industries has continued to rise, attracted by the region\u2019s growing markets, economic growth and developing internet economy. FDI in logistics, although small, is gaining increasing attention from logistics MNEs, including ASEAN companies. Many major MNEs in banking, retail and logistics are present in ASEAN. They are involved in different segments of value chains, by expanding into new locations and by opening more stores. Some ASEAN Member States are still relatively underserved by banks, especially in the CLMV countries. The size of the underserved banking segment suggests that there is scope for investment in banking, including the use of technology to reach the unserved in the region. Digital technology has also played a role in shaping the services industry landscape. Banks are making investments in fintech activities and in some cases have acquired companies with fintech capabilities. Digital technology has also brought"

The rapid rise in e-commerce has contributed to an increase in retail activities and in start-ups. In logistics, digital technology is being applied to improve efficiency in supply chain management, and the number of start-ups in this industry is also increasing. The prospects for services FDI (in banking, retail and logistics) are promising because of the improving investment environment, rapid rise in trade volumes, increasing logistics efficiency and demand, rise in e-commerce and emergence of new players. In addition, the rising number of middle-income consumers, the large population and the growing consumerism and regional integration will further increase the attractiveness of ASEAN for services investment. Further growth of FDI in services will be underpinned by the different regional agreements signed recently, and the implementation of the various programmes of the AEC Blueprint 2025. These agreements include the ASEAN Trade in Services Agreement (ATISA), signed in 2019, which builds upon the market liberalization achieved under the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS) and the ASEAN Agreement on e-Commerce, signed in 2018, which aimed to increase digital connectivity, and advance trade rules and strengthen the environment for e-commerce. Under AEC 2025, characterized by free flows of goods, services, investment and capital, the region will offer investors an even more attractive location for FDI in services. 105 Chapter 2 FDI in Services NOTES 1 Economist Intelligence Unit, Industry Report, Financial services, Malaysia, 2nd quarter 2019. 2 Economist Intelligence Unit, Industry report, Financial services, Singapore, 3rd quarter 2019. 3 Reuters, \u201cFacebook to invest $1 billion in first Asian data center in Singapore\u201d, 6 September 2018. 4 Economist Intelligence Unit, Industry report, Financial services, Thailand, 1st quarter 2019. 5 Economist Intelligence Unit, Industry report, Consumer goods and retail, Vietnam, 1st"

PART TWO INVESTMENT IN HEALTH CARE 109 CHAPTER 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN 3.1. INTRODUCTION Health care is an important industry in the services sector. It has significant implications for social, demographic and economic development. The health care industry encompasses the provision of medical care (curative, preventive and palliative), pharmaceuticals, medical technology and equipment, health insurance, research and development (R&D) centres and educational institutions. The health care expenditure in ASEAN accounts for 4 per cent of the region\u2019s GDP, much less than the world average of 10 per cent.1 The provision of health care in ASEAN has traditionally been the responsibility of the public sector. With budgetary constraints, growing populations and changing demographics, the public sector faces significant challenges to meet current and future demand. The private sector, including foreign health care companies, can complement the efforts of the public sector in the delivery of care. This report focuses on private investment, in particular FDI and foreign companies in the health care industry in ASEAN. It does not cover public health issues or public investments in health care. The objective of this chapter is to analyse the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) and multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the development of the health care industry in ASEAN (box 3.1). The chapter examines the interrelationship between various segments of the health care value chain and the roles of different categories of investors, companies and stakeholders.

Definition and scope of health care Investment in health care refers to all types of foreign investment (e.g. FDI, venture capital, private equity, non-equity arrangements), different modes of market entry (mergers and acquisitions (M&As), greenfield projects and joint ventures) and different channels of foreign involvement (e.g. technology suppliers, financiers, management contracts, knowledge or R&D collaboration) in the following segments of the health care value chain: \u2022 Health care infrastructure (e.g. private hospitals, clinics, specialized medical centres, diagnostic centres, nursing homes) \u2022 Manufacturing (pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and devices) \u2022 Application and development of medical technologies (digital technology, medical solutions) \u2022 Distribution and wholesaling of medical equipment, devices and pharmaceuticals \u2022 Insurance (medical insurance) \u2022 Other services supporting the health care industry (logistics, information technology and business process management (IT-BPM), specialized services) \u2022 Strategic collaboration and alliances such as in R&D, knowledge sharing and training 3.2. KEY FEATURES OF HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IN ASEAN Key features of the industry in ASEAN include the rapid rise in demand for health care services and facilities, the important role of the private sector, the growth in medical tourism (in some Member States), commitment to universal health care coverage and the improving health care investment environment. Rising population ASEAN is a $3 trillion economy and home to 650 million people, accounting for about 9 per cent of the world population in 2018 (table 3.1). By 2025, the population is expected to reach nearly 700 million and more than 790 million by"

Longer life expectancy and increase in older population The life expectancy in the region has improved over the past 15 years. In 1990, average life expectancy was between 64 and 65 years old. By 2016, the average life expectancy had increased to 73 years.2 By 2050, more than one-fifth of the region\u2019s population will be over 60 years old.3 Longer life expectancy and an increase in the older population will have implications for the demand for health and for geriatric care facilities. Growing middle-class population and increasing chronic disease incidence The region is witnessing a growing middle-class population and affluent consumers who are more health conscious. In 2012, the middle class in ASEAN was estimated at 190 million 111 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN people.4 By 2020, that number is projected to more than double, to 400 million.5 The growing middle-class base means a continued rise in demand for health care and an opportunity for private investment in hospitals and other care services. Rising per capita income and changing lifestyles are contributing to the prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases, which requires long-term treatment and care. The incidence of chronic diseases in the region is expected to double from 2001 to 2025.6 Health care expenditure In 2016, ASEAN\u2019s health care expenditure was $99 billion, which was equivalent to 1.3 per cent of world health care expenditure. Health expenditure per capita in the region was $113 in 2010 (table 3.1). By 2025, the per capita health care expenditure is expected to rise 3.2 times to $364.7 Health care spending in the region by that time is expected to reach at least $269 billion, more than"

However, the health care delivery market remains significantly under-penetrated and under-supplied, while demand continues to rise. Countries in the region thus face a significant demand as well as supply challenge (chapter 4). In 2016, ASEAN\u2019s average health care expenditure as a percentage of regional GDP stood at 4 per cent. It significantly trails that of the world and developed nations (e.g. 9 per cent by Australia and 17 per cent by United States) and behind the average expenditure of East Asia and the Pacific developing economies (figure 3.1). This relatively low number suggests that there is scope for an increase in health care investment against the backdrop of increasing demand. Table 3.1.

Cost advantages, affordable and high-quality private health care facilities, and tourism values are key factors contributing to the growth of this industry segment. Notwithstanding the decline in the number of medical tourists to Singapore in recent years, the country remains an attractive medical tourism hub, especially for more complex medical cases. Rising costs in Singapore and better services in private hospitals in medical tourists\u2019 home countries are the main reasons for the decline in medical tourism in Singapore. Other Member States such as the Philippines and Viet Nam are also receiving medical tourists mostly from neighbouring countries for better quality and affordable treatment. Figure 3.1.

Aside from affordable care services, these Member States have taken a combination of measures, which include targeted policy development, coordinated institutional support and cross-ministry and agency cooperation to support medical tourism with the view to strengthen the health care ecosystem. Growing private health care investment and services Private investment is a key feature and is significant across all health care segments in ASEAN. In some, such as hospitals and pharmaceuticals, private investment is rising. The private sector has been investing in and operating hospitals across ASEAN with different degrees of involvement (table 3.3). In some Member States, private hospitals account for more than 50 per cent of all hospitals or more than 20 per cent of hospital beds, while in others such as the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam, private sector participation is relatively low but increasing.

For example, Indonesia launched a national health insurance scheme in 2014;9 previously more than 125 million people (more than half the population) lacked access to state health coverage, and state or private health insurance.10 In 2017, 76 per cent of the Indonesian population are covered by the national health care insurance. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Cambodia have partially implemented universal health care, covering about 12 per cent and 17 per cent of their populations respectively. Myanmar is implementing Myanmar Health Vision 2030 as a step towards universal coverage.11 Thailand has a successful national health care insurance to cover all citizens.

Most of the funding has come from investment by ASEAN VCs or by VCs based in the region, mainly in Singapore. These investors include corporate VCs (e.g. UOB (Singapore) and Kickstart Ventures (Philippines)) that invest in health care start-ups.

The lack of health care assets, the less mature M&A environment and the regulatory environment limits the number of health care M&As in the region. Small-value transactions and the lack of megadeals also contribute to the low M&A values. Most M&A transactions take place in the more developed ASEAN markets (e.g. Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand). Asian investors are major acquirers of health care assets or companies in the region. Hospitals, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment are the largest target segments for cross- border M&As (table 3.6, table 3.7). Most of the hospital M&A deals are by PEs. They are active investors in hospitals and home health care services.

Market factors and the relatively low-cost structure that enables the delivery of affordable health care services in the region are key aspects in investment decisions.

Many of the major drug companies in ASEAN have continued to expand or reinvest in the region to increase production capacity and move into new business functions (upgrading in the value chain). The existence of capable local pharmaceutical companies to be contract manufacturers has also played a key role in improving the investment environment, which helps attract pharmaceuticals FDI. The size of the pharmaceuticals market in the region and the host country are important determinants. The commitment of ASEAN Member States towards universal health care provides opportunities for MNEs to produce and service local markets. Some MNEs or foreign entities have invested in the health care industry (e.g. hospitals) in ASEAN because of strategic reasons. They include non-health care companies, sovereign wealth funds (e.g. Khazanah (Malaysia) and Temasek (Singapore)) and pension funds"

Non-health care companies or conglomerates invest in health care (e.g. Mitsui, Itochu, Sojitz and Mitsubishi (all Japanese)) to diversify their business portfolio or to seize investment opportunities in strategic health care assets in the region. PE and VC companies are involved because of investment opportunities in a growing industry. Some non-health companies, such as those in real estate (e.g. Rojana (Thailand)) and other industries (e.g. a subsidiary of Toyota) invest in health care by forming alliances and partnerships to establish a foothold in the health care markets of host countries. The availability of strong local partners has also facilitated joint ventures and strategic alliances by major health care companies in the region such as in the hospital and pharmaceutical segments. Many ASEAN health care providers, manufacturers and start-ups have internationalized. They venture overseas to grow, to seize investment opportunities and to diversify their geographical reach. The burgeoning pharmaceuticals industry in some ASEAN Member States also has attracted them to establish a presence and to be close to markets and customers. 121 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN 3.4. ACTORS OF HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IN ASEAN Foreign MNEs and ASEAN companies are significant actors in the region\u2019s growing health care industry (section 3.6). They operate in different segments of the value chain (table 3.9). There are differences between them in terms of corporate activities, expertise and internationalization objectives. In hospital services, ASEAN hospital groups and PEs are major private investors. The pharmaceuticals and health insurance segments have a significant number of international MNEs, many of which have been in ASEAN for several decades. Table 3.9. Different"

Emerging opportunities to establish hospitals and clinics are driving ASEAN hospitals (and foreign interests) to invest in these countries (table 3.12). Equity investments Some ASEAN hospital groups operate integrated businesses that involved other segments of the health care value chain (e.g. insurance, pharmaceuticals distribution and manufacturing). Some have established investment companies or holding companies abroad (e.g. in Singapore) with the purpose to undertake investment in hospitals and other health care activities in the region \u2013 adding to the complexity of their corporate structure (box 3.2). Large hospital groups, especially those with Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation for health care service quality, have also established representative offices in target host countries to facilitate medical tourism.

Key features and characteristics of ASEAN hospital groups The large hospital groups in ASEAN have similar features and corporate arrangements. Some of these features and characteristics include complex structures and multiple subsidiaries, and international partnerships and affiliations. Complex structure and multiple subsidiaries Some homegrown ASEAN hospital chains operate different health care brands that help them to target different segments of the market, both at home and abroad. For example, BDMS, the largest medical group in Thailand, has 45 hospitals and medical entities there as well as two in Cambodia (section 3.6.1). It has six hospital brands: Bangkok Hospitals (21 hospitals), Samitivej Hospitals (6), BNH Hospitals (1), Phyathai Hospitals (5), Paolo Hospitals (6) and The Royal Hospitals (2). The two Royal Hospitals are in Cambodia. BDMS is looking at other neighbouring countries for future expansion. The IHH Healthcare (Malaysia) consists of a network of hospitals and a few major brands (e.g. Mount Elizabeth, Gleneagles, Pantai, Parkway and Fortis). The two Mount Elizabeth hospitals in Singapore attract many medical tourists. The Parkway Pantai group of hospitals is mostly in Malaysia and Singapore. It has also acquired a significant stake in Fortis, which has hospitals network in India. Siloam International Hospitals, under the Lippo Group (Indonesia), has hospitals in the country under the Siloam brand. The group"

For instance, BDMS\u2019s health care portfolio includes international pharmaceuticals business (manufacturing of sterile and generic pharmaceutical products and distribution), drugstores (retailing), medical devices and equipment, pathology services and health insurance. International partnerships and affiliations The major ASEAN hospital groups also have strategic investment interests with foreign partners. They have established alliances and partnership with major MNEs to supply pharmaceuticals, equipment and medical solutions. Some have also established knowledge collaboration in R&D activities, training and education. For instance, BDMS (Thailand) has partnerships with specialized medical centres and colleges in Japan, the United States, and Europe; Raffles Hospital (Singapore) is affiliated with the United States-based Mayo Clinic Care Network; Maayo Medical (Philippines) has Ottobock (a German medical technology company) as one of its partners; PT Siloam International (Indonesia) signed an agreement in 2017 with Philips (Netherlands) to supply, maintain and service health care technology and equipment in all of Siloam\u2019s hospitals in Indonesia.

In this way, they contribute to the development of the health care industry in the region and connect with private health care providers in ASEAN. Aside from hospital groups, some ASEAN health care companies have also opened medical clinics and laboratories in other ASEAN Member States. They include Q and M Dental Group (Singapore) for dental care, Cordlife (Singapore) for health and allied services and Clearbridge Health (Singapore) in medical laboratory. Singapore Medical Group invested in Careplus Clinic Vietnam (a health care specialist services provider that focuses on health screening, women\u2019s health, pediatrics and diagnostic imaging). Not all major hospital groups expand to other ASEAN Member States. Those from a home country with a large domestic market (e.g. Indonesia, the Philippines) have a limited overseas presence because they have chosen to focus on expansion at home. PT Mitra Keluarga Karyasehat (Indonesia), with 19 hospitals, and Metro Pacific Hospital Holdings (Philippines), with 14, do not invest outside the country. In contrast, hospital groups from Malaysia and Singapore have investments outside their home countries because of the limited market at home and as part of their business strategy to operate close to patients abroad. Some Thai hospital groups also established hospital facilities in the CLMV countries to serve patients there. Non-equity participation ASEAN hospital groups have foreign involvement in their hospital business through collaboration on hospital development, medical knowledge and technology issues. For instance, a network of hospitals owned by the VinGroup Corporation (Viet Nam) has foreign collaborations in oncology, cardiology, organ transplantation and hospital management.

In tapping the growing demand for health care services in ASEAN, some medical services companies and hospitals from Japan have established representatives in offices in the region. For example, IMS International Medical Support opened a medical service support company in Hanoi in April 2019 with two major Japanese health care companies (I-cell Networks and Assam Company). The joint-venture company provides information, counselling and support services for Vietnamese patients wishing to travel to Japan for examination and treatment. It also provides health care services and coordinates with Vinmec Hospital and Thong Nhat Hospital in Viet Nam after patients return home.18 3.4.2.2. European MNEs The European health-related MNEs in ASEAN are concentrated in the pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and health insurance segments. A few European hospitals operate in the CLMV countries (e.g. in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and in Viet Nam). Two major international standard hospitals in Viet Nam (L\u2019H\u00f4pital Fran\u00e7ais de Hanoi and Franco- Vietnamese Hospital in Ho Chi Minh) are owned and managed by French companies and doctors. Franco-Vietnamese Hospital is 100 per cent foreign-owned by Medical Founders Holding (Hong Kong, China), the company of the French founders, and by Quadria Capital, a PE company based in Singapore. Many European pharmaceuticals and equipment manufacturers operate in ASEAN with multiple subsidiaries and in different ASEAN Member States. They include AstraZeneca (United Kingdom), Bayer (Germany), Mylan (Netherlands), Novartis (Switzerland), Novo Nordisk (Denmark) and Solvay (Belgium) (section 3.4.3). They serve the local market and export abroad. 133 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN European MNEs enter the ASEAN health care market through direct investments, joint ventures and collaborations with local health care"

The government is encouraging domestic drug manufacturing to reduce reliance on imported drugs (particularly patented ones). This is one of the reasons behind the decision of Taisho (Japan) to scale up engagement in Viet Nam. It acquired a 24.4 per cent stake in Hau Giang Pharmaceutical JSC (DHG) (Viet Nam) in 2016. The equity stake and alliance with DHG enable the partners to share knowledge, technology and experience in the pharmaceuticals business. In 2016, Abbott (United States) acquired Glomed Pharmaceutical Company, a leading Vietnamese drug manufacturer.

ASEAN pharmaceutical companies Many ASEAN pharmaceutical companies focus on producing for and serving their respective domestic markets. These local companies have manufacturing facilities to produce their own brands of generic drugs and serve niche markets. Many are contract manufacturers to foreign and local pharmaceuticals companies (table 3.20). Their contract services increase the competitiveness of their countries for FDI in pharmaceuticals. Some ASEAN pharmaceutical companies have established joint-venture partnerships and strategic alliances with major MNEs and other ASEAN pharmaceutical companies, including as contract manufacturers (box 3.4). Local knowledge and business networks play a role in making them a local partner of choice. They have a better understanding of local culture and language, consumer behaviour and domestic distribution points. Box 3.4.

Health care start-ups offer a wide range of technological and medical solutions, from surgical robotics, artificial intelligence (AI) and tele-health to data analytics and cloud applications (section 3.5). They are involved in providing health solutions to assist patients, improving surgical procedures, distributing medical equipment, developing AI and data analytics applications, and delivering tele-health and telemedicine services (box 3.5). 145 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN Box 3.5. Definitions of tele-health and telemedicine A common feature of tele-health and telemedicine is that they both use information and communication technologies to overcome geographical barriers in providing clinical support with the goal of improving health outcomes. Tele-health Tele-health involves the use of telecommunications and virtual technology to deliver health care outside of traditional health care facilities. For example, it could include virtual home health care, which may involve guidance in certain procedures for patients or elderly people in their homes. Health care workers in remote areas could use tele-health to obtain guidance from professionals elsewhere on the diagnosis, care and referral of patients. Telemedicine Telemedicine is a subset of tele-health. WHO defines telemedicine as \u201cThe delivery of health care services, where distance is a critical factor, by all health care professionals using information and communication technologies for the exchange of valid information for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease and injuries, research and evaluation, and for the continuing education of health care providers, all in the interests of advancing the health of individuals and their communities\u201d (WHO 2010, p. 9).

However, some quickly scale up and expand to neighbouring ASEAN Member States to diversify their geographical coverage and to exploite their proprietary advantages through FDI. First-mover advantages and success in fundraising for expansion also play roles in encouraging start-ups to venture abroad quickly. Some start-ups have established strategic partnership with bigger corporations for the delivery of care services, which also facilitated their internationalization. Top 50 most-funded medical technology start-ups The top 50 of these start-ups in ASEAN had raised nearly $1 billion in venture capital funding as of July 2019, with nearly 80 per cent raising their funds since 2017. This underpins the rapid growth in fundraising by health care start-ups in the region. These firms mostly operate in tele- health, medical devices, biotechnology and health solutions segment (figure 3.8). A majority of these top 50 are based in Singapore (39), and they accounted for more than 88 per cent of all funds raised by start-ups in the region (figures 3.9 and 3.10). Singapore\u2019s more developed start-up and medical ecosystems explain the high concentration in that country (AIR 2017, 2018). 146 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 \u2013 FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Some of these start-ups have not yet internationalized.

These companies include those in insurance, IT-BPM services, logistics and specialized hospital cleaning services. 3.4.5.1. Health insurance Health insurance provides coverage to hedge against the risk of significant out-of-pocket health care costs and uncertainty about the need for medical treatment. It plays an important role in supporting the development of the health care industry through providing insurance coverage. There are three main categories of insurance: national health insurance by the public sector, corporate health insurance and private health insurance. Private health insurance involves two main groups of actors: insurance MNEs that offer health insurance in host countries and in ASEAN, and hospital groups in the region that provide health insurance plans to policyholders. The provision of health insurance in ASEAN is dominated by major insurance MNEs, mainly from developed countries, and many have been in the region for decades. For instance, Aetna (United States) and Cigna (United States) have operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. Similarly, AXA (France) has a commercial presence in a number of ASEAN Member States. Insufficient hospital beds and facilities, possible high out-of-pocket costs and customers\u2019 desire to have quick access to health care continue to drive the demand for private health insurance. This has translated into business opportunities for health insurance providers, including insurance MNEs.

There are also links between insurance companies and tele-health. Health care service providers are working closely with insurance companies to develop insurance plan to meet patients\u2019 needs. In expanding their policyholder base, insurance companies are developing partnerships and alliances with various stakeholders including hospitals, government and tele-health companies, as well as policyholders themselves (box 3.7).

DIGITAL REVOLUTION AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION COMPANIES IN ASEAN The application of digital technologies (e.g. robotics, artificial intelligence, data analytics, cloud and 3D printing) in health care is changing the industry and in the delivery of care services to patients in the region. Actors that used and developed such technologies include foreign digital and health care MNEs and start-ups in ASEAN. The use of such technologies in the provision of health care (e.g hospitals and clinics) in ASEAN is expanding because of positive externalities. They include improvements in health care efficiency and medical precision, better diagnostic and analytic capabilities, and better patient care outcomes (e.g. faster patient recovery with minimal incisions). Hospitals and other stakeholders in ASEAN are also using such digital technologies to improve administrative and marketing functions and to better reach out to customers, including in digitizing medical records for data analytics. Major health care providers in the region have used digital technology to advance the quality of care and to provide greater access to care (box 3.8). For example, the Bumrungrad International Hospital (Thailand) has integrated the IBM Watson technology into the hospital\u2019s oncology department to process patient data, access medical literature and provide guidelines to offer personalized treatments to cancer patients. The IBM Watson has a processing power of 80 teraflops and can access 90 servers, with data storage of more than 200 million pages. 155 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the"

Many of these health care MNEs also have established a presence in the region to provide aftercare services, training and education in the use of such technologies and equipment. Some MNEs have also established related R&D centres in Singapore and data centres in a few Member States (e.g. Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore) (AIR 2018). ASEAN start-ups have also contributed to the development of the health care industry through their digital innovation in medical solutions in areas such as tele-health and telemedicine and other medical technologies (section 3.4.4). Box 3.8. Applying digital technologies in health care Hospitals in ASEAN are using or planning to use cloud technologies to improve efficiency. Such technologies are linked to cloud computing suppliers and data centres. Developed-country MNEs are the main actors in this segment (AIR 2018). Cloud technology can help hospitals achieve cost effectiveness, as it uses less electricity since data centres are running off-site and capital costs could be low because of less hardware needed. Cloud resources are scalable and provide flexibility, which facilitate easier management of growth and capacity-planning. It is more secure and could handle significant data storage requirements from off-site places. Robotics technology and telemedicine improve"

In Thailand, the Robodoctor (manufactured by Intouch Health (United States)) is used in a number of hospitals. The technology allows specialist doctors in hub hospitals to assist doctors in remote hospitals in diagnosing and treating patients with complicated conditions, such as stroke. The technology increases the result of more efficient diagnosis and treatment. Similarly, the Bangkok Hospital network also used Robodoctor in three of its hospitals (Bangkok Hospital, Bangkok Hospital Pattaya, and Bangkok Hospital Phuket). Bumrungrad hospital (Thailand) has also employed robotic technology to increase efficiency such as a robot pharmacist. Robots are being tested in Singapore hospitals for porter services. An example is Rowa Vmax, manufactured by CareFushion (Germany). It retrieves medicine from a storage cabinet when a prescription has to be filled, automatically updates stocks and sends an alert when supplies are low. Hospitals in Singapore such as Tan Tock Seng and National University Hospital uses the Rowa Vmax. While many of these medical robotic technologies are developed and supplied to ASEAN hospitals by MNEs from the United States, European countries and Japan, there are ASEAN- based start-ups developing surgical technologies too. They include EndoMaster (Singapore), with its robotic-assisted surgical system for endoscopy that enables surgeons to perform incision-less surgeries (section 3.6.3). Robots have been developed and are used for elderly care and for recovering patients. These robots assist doctors and nurses in monitoring blood pressure and other health information.

CONCLUSION The ASEAN health care landscape is changing because of rapid growth in demand, increasing private participation, an improving investment environment and the advancement of digital revolution and medical technologies on the delivery of care. The development of the health care industry, however, varies between countries (chapter 4). The growing population, changing demographics and increasing middle class are contributing to the health care demand challenge. With limited resources, the public sector cannot meet this challenge alone. The private sector, including FDI, can play a role by complementing the efforts of the public sector in developing the health care industry and in delivery of affordable services. FDI and foreign participation in health care in ASEAN are rising. Foreign companies are contributing to"

Foreign companies and institutions collaborate or establish alliances with ASEAN health care providers (hospitals) in training, education, R&D activities and knowledge exchange. This relationship, through equity and non-equity forms, is important for the development of an efficient health care ecosystem in the region. 193 Chapter 3 Foreign Investments and MNEs in the Health Care Industry in ASEAN There are various categories of actors in the health care industry. Homegrown ASEAN health care companies (hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and start-ups) have also internationalized to other ASEAN Member States to grow, diversify markets and take advantage of emerging opportunities. Both private hospital groups and PEs are major investors in hospitals in the region. Some major hospital groups have foreign investment stakes in them. Major global pharmaceutical MNEs are present in ASEAN, operating in multiple locations and with multiple business functions. Many global pharmaceuticals and insurance MNEs have long had business ties with countries in the region. They continue to expand operations, driven by investment opportunities, cost advantages and market potential. In general, FDI across the health care value chain (from hospitals, clinics and pharmaceuticals to insurance) is market-seeking. Engaging in a joint venture with local partners is a common feature of MNEs\u2019 participation in the region\u2019s pharmaceuticals segment, especially in marketing and distribution functions. Local knowledge, distribution channels and business networks of local partners are important considerations. Contract manufacturing is another key feature. This segment involves ASEAN and foreign companies as contract manufacturers to local firms and also to other MNEs. The vibrant contract manufacturing sector increases the competitiveness of ASEAN Member States in attracting pharmaceuticals FDI (for both market-seeking and efficiency-seeking motives).

These start-ups are also partnering with larger firms to scale up and to expand market reach across the region \u2013 thereby contributing to the development of the health care industry and broader access to health care facilities. Local and foreign health care actors across the value chain can help improve the efficiency and quality of care in ASEAN through the health infrastructure they build and manage, pharmaceuticals manufacturing and distribution (generating import substitution and export promotion effects), the supply of modern medical equipment and devices, alliances in sharing of knowledge and best practices, and provision of health insurance. Although international insurance MNEs are major actors in the insurance segment, ASEAN health care providers such as hospitals are also involved in providing health insurance coverage. ASEAN hospitals and clinics are using modern medical technologies and equipment (e.g. robots for surgery) supplied by foreign health care companies through their agents and distributors based in the region. Some ASEAN companies have developed robotic medical equipment and solutions including telemedicine that have expanded health care activities to more people. Another key feature of the health care industry in the region is the rise in medical tourism. Some Member States have witnessed a rapid growth in medical tourism because of their affordable and better quality medical care environment, which is the result of targeted and coordinated 194 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 \u2013 FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care national policies and efforts (chapter 4).

INTRODUCTION Regional development and cooperation among the ASEAN Member States have contributed to the improvement of the region\u2019s investment environment. MNEs and ASEAN companies operating in the health care industry in the region need to evaluate the changing health care landscape, which is continuously shaped by national development and implementation of regional health-care-related policies. Stakeholders should monitor the health care investment environment as ASEAN continues to integrate through the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint 2025. By 2025, the AEC is expected to become a single market of nearly 700 million people in a $4.7 trillion economy. It will also further strengthen the competitive production base, which is characterized by free flows of goods, services, investment, capital and skilled labour as well as a more strongly connected region. Following from the analyses of chapter 3, this chapter analyses the importance of the regional and national investment environments in relation to FDI in health care. The chapter highlights regional health care cooperation (economic aspects) and the implications of economic agreements for health care investment. It also presents"

The focus is on policies to stimulate and regulate cross-border investment, including intraregional investment, in the health care industry. 4.2. REGIONAL COOPERATION IN HEALTH CARE Health care is an important area of social and economic cooperation in ASEAN. Regional cooperation has evolved from addressing social and public health issues to incorporating economic aspects of health, with implications for investment and the development of the health care industry. 198 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 \u2013 FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care Over the years, ASEAN\u2019s economic integration has resulted in significant agreements, measures and institutional development. Major ASEAN economic agreements have improved the region\u2019s investment environment for health care. They include the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement (ACIA), the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS), the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) as well as other aspects of the development of the AEC. The implementation of these agreements has affected the investment environment in terms of liberalization (e.g. market opening, foreign equity ownership), facilitation and cross-sectoral linkages. Ongoing efforts to harmonize health regulatory issues, including through the MRAs, have implications for investment, business operational strategy and the efficiency of the health care environment. During AEC 2015, health care cooperation was accorded importance as one of the 11 priority sectors identified for accelerated integration. Monitoring and understanding regional commitments and development in health care is imperative for players and other stakeholders to operate efficiently. As Member States open up their health care markets and as regional agreements push for further liberalization as well as harmonization of standards, opportunities for health care FDI in ASEAN will continue to grow. 4.2.1. Development context Health care cooperation in ASEAN started in 1980."

Stronger regional health care cooperation started in the mid-2000s with more frequent ministerial meetings (at least every two years) to address the threat of infectious diseases (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza) and to mitigate the economic impact of such threats (e.g. disrupted working hours, productivity and tourism). In 2006, the ASEAN health ministers addressed the need to enhance competitiveness in health-related products and services, strengthen capacity for good clinical practice and clinical trials, and promote healthy lifestyles.1 As ASEAN cooperation on social aspects of health care has strengthened over the years, cooperation on economic aspects has also gathered strength. Under AEC 2015, the economic aspect of health care development involved elimination of import tariffs, opening-up of health services trade, and harmonization of standards and technical regulations for health and medical devices. Health care integration has been given specific attention under the AEC Blueprint 2025, which involves sector-strategic action plans and measures. Over the years, ASEAN-wide efforts related to health care have transformed from initial sectoral cooperation mainly on public health issues to include cross-sectoral arrangements with social and economic dimensions. Health care features prominently in major ASEAN economic agreements, attesting to the significance of the industry and of health care development to the region. 199 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN 4.2.2.

Evidence of this growth in confidence are the growing production networks, strengthening regional value chains and increasing trade volumes, expanding operations of MNEs, continuously rising FDI including intra-ASEAN investment across industries, and rising favourable investment sentiments about the region (AIR 2017, 2018). AEC 2015 has also influenced many MNEs and indigenous companies to begin operating in ASEAN as a single market. The second phase of AEC development under the AEC Blueprint 2025 (2016\u20132025) entails implementation of some activities carried over from AEC 2015 and enhanced programmes and plans to realize the goal of a more strongly and comprehensively integrated region.

Some Member States have underdeveloped and insufficient medical facilities from years of underinvestment. In the face of the lack of better-quality facilities and equipment, patients in Member States such as Indonesia, Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam travel to neighbouring countries for medical services on an out-of-pocket payment basis. All Member States have plans for universal health care coverage. By 2030, citizens in all ASEAN Member States are expected to have access to health care.

In some cases, strong institutional support and targeted policies promoting medical tourism played an important role in the success of these Member States in attracting medical tourists (chapter 3). Some, like Viet Nam, are also receiving an increasing flow of foreign patients from neighbouring countries. Health care spending in the region has been relatively low compared with that of the OECD countries, suggesting room for further expenditure and investment to develop and upgrade the health care industry.

Many are encouraging the development of domestic capacity and industry in areas such as pharmaceutical production for local markets as well as for export. Some Member States are actively promoting private investment in more advanced areas of health care such as biomedical, life sciences and R&D. Many Member States have in recent years further opened up the health care industry to FDI and are allowing completely foreign-owned operations in hospitals and other health care subsectors, such as the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. However, such operations must meet certain requirements, such as thresholds for investment capital. Investment incentives are provided to approved health care projects, which generally include tax holidays and exemptions from import duties for equipment. Health care investment projects located in special economic zones (SEZs) also receive additional investment incentives. The following subsections detail the state of health care services and investment in them in each ASEAN Member State. 4.3.1. Brunei Darussalam Public health care services are either free or heavily subsidized by the Government. The out-of- pocket payment per capita is relatively low.

Indonesia Public health expenditure has been increasing and the population is ageing (table 4.5). Public health expenditure per capita rose from $63 in 2010 to $162 in 2016. Out-of-pocket health care expenditure has declined from 57 per cent of total health expenditure in 2010 to 37 per cent in 2016, suggesting an increase in the provision of public health facilities to the population. The health care system in the country continued to face challenges in 2018. Although public expenditure has increased, health care services remain inadequate and unevenly distributed. The lack of a skilled workforce also limits the development of the health care industry. To reach more of the population, including in remote areas, future reforms are likely, especially in the use of digital technology or new medical technology (e.g. telemedicine or e-health).

Foreign investment in health care Malaysia has attracted many major MNEs in health care, covering hospital services, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and medical equipment, distribution of pharmaceuticals and health insurance (table 4.8). Foreign companies have made significant contributions to the development of the health care industry in Malaysia. They include (i) capital investment (e.g. new establishments require an investment in the range of RM 200 million to RM 400 million), (ii) employment generation (for graduate doctors, nurses, pharmacists and medical-related courses), (iii) modernization of hospital infrastructure and systems (e.g. EMRs), and (iv) technology and specialized medical equipment, which includes robotic devices for surgery procedures.

Responding to the growing demand for such products in the region, leading Malaysian pharmaceuticals companies are moving into the production of biologics, oncology drugs and high value added generic compounds. Challenges There are challenges in attracting FDI in health care, especially in recruiting talent to support emerging health care industries or products and in developing raw materials for pharmaceuticals production. For instance, strict policy and regulations on hiring foreign doctors, which limit opportunities for investment from other countries. Strong competition from neighbouring countries in health care services is posing a challenge in medical tourism. New expertise and skills for complex products need to be developed. The medical devices and pharmaceuticals industries require (i) skilled personnel in specific areas such as biomedical, mechatronic, mechanical, advanced materials and nanotechnology devices and (ii) industrial pharmacists and production and process engineers. Raw materials availability could be improved. This challenge relates to the following: (i) Necessary imports of certain main raw materials such as APIs, titanium and medical-grade resin, as no local manufacturers exist (ii) Import substitution, as the Government encourages local companies to scale up and diversify operations to supply to industry players 220 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 \u2013 FDI in Services:"

Myanmar Health care services in Myanmar are underdeveloped and insufficient following years of underinvestment. The country also faces a shortage of professionals and wide geographical disparities in access to health care. The public sector is the dominant supplier of care services. As Myanmar embraces economic reform and liberalization in 2011, private sector participation in the health care industry has improved. The public sector is planning more investment in health care. With a limited budget, the Government is encouraging the establishment of PPPs to develop the industry and to meet increasing demand. Some citizens travel to neighbouring countries such as Thailand for medical care. Government expenditure on health care increased from 0.2 per cent of GDP in 2009 (one of the lowest in the world) to 1.2 per cent in 2018.

The new Myanmar Investment Law 2016, which replaces the Myanmar Citizen Investment Law 2013 and the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law 2012, liberalized the industry for investment. It also streamlined the process for investment applications. Foreign investment into private hospitals, clinics, diagnostic services, production of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and private medical and health-related education institutions, is allowed subject to approval requirements. Under the AFAS, foreign ownership in investment in hospitals is allowed up to 70 per cent. Importation and resale of medical equipment is permitted to foreign investors in joint venture with a Myanmar partner. Some activities are restricted, such as health centres for the elderly and domestic laboratory research. Investment incentives Certain subsectors in health care, such as hospital services, medical laboratories and clinics are promoted through investment incentives. Investors in these subsectors are eligible for tax exemptions for a period of three, five or seven years, depending on the location of the investment. Additional incentives are provided for projects in SEZs. In response to the severe shortage of medical devices, regulations on import and resale of medical equipment provide a most-favoured-nation duty rate of 1.5 per cent and an exemption from commercial tax. The import licence fee is exempted on 67 kinds of medicines and pharmaceutical raw materials used in the manufacture of medicines.

The law also expands the coverage of the Philippine Health Insurance System (PhilHealth) to include free medical consultations and laboratory tests. It designated PhilHealth as the national purchaser of medicines, health goods and services for individuals. Strategic engagement of the private sector and improvement of the delivery of health services were also emphasized.39 According to the law, PhilHealth members are classified into two groups: contributory (premium contributors from payroll) and non-contributory (fully subsidized from tax collections). The funding of the previous universal health coverage programme was accomplished through subsidies and contributions from employers and employees.40 The country is promoting e-health to reach more people and to make more use of digital technology in health care.

Thailand\u2019s universal health coverage programme started in 2002. It is financed by three sources of public health insurance (i.e. civil servant medical benefit scheme, social health insurance and a basic universal health coverage arrangement), which today covers almost all of the citizens. The public sector is the main provider of health care services, complemented by services provided by an active private sector. The national expenditure on health care has been increasing, from $172 per capita or 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2010 to $222 or 3.7 per cent of GDP in 2016. Out-of-pocket expenses have remained relatively stable at $25 per capita in 2010 and $27 in 2016, suggesting an increasing use of public facilities.

Medical devices The value of medical devices imported into Thailand grew from $557 million in 2011 to $962 million in 2018 (figure 4.1). Over the same period, the value of exports of medical devices increased from $554 million to $843 million.

Pharmaceuticals Thailand\u2019s spending on pharmaceuticals is growing rapidly, doubling between 2010 and 2018 as a percentage of GDP (figure 4.2). This is primarily due to the increasing demand for pharmaceuticals from the ageing population. Other contributing factors include the country\u2019s universal health coverage and the continued growth of medical tourism.

In 2018, 87 per cent of the population was covered, up from 68 per cent in 2013. The Government is aiming for universal coverage by 2030. The health insurance premium averages about 4.5 per cent of the reference wage, but the Government substantially subsidizes premiums to the poorest people, students, children under age 6 and beneficiaries of social assistance programmes. The Social Health Insurance Fund accounted for 22 per cent of health expenditure in 2016; however, voluntary health insurance accounted for only 1 per cent of health expenditure.62 Policy encouraging FDI in health care The Investment Law (2014) lists health R&D activities, development of infrastructure facilities and pharmaceuticals production as eligible for investment incentives. Health care service is among the 11 services industries open to foreign investment in Viet Nam\u2019s WTO Commitments. Except for distribution of pharmaceutical products and medications, foreign investors can invest in health care establishments, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and medical education and training units. Foreign investment up to 100 per cent equity ownership is allowed in each of these subsectors with certain conditions on the capital requirement. For example, the capital investment for a hospital is $20 million, whereas a polyclinic requires an investment of $2 million and a specialized clinic $200,000. Home care, nursing and emergency evacuation services are subject to approval on a case-by-case basis.63 Government policy on the"

For example, Abbott Laboratories (United States) now holds a 52 per cent majority share of Domesco Medical Import Export, a leading pharmaceutical company listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange. Japanese Taisho Group spent about $48 million to lift its ownership in DHG Pharma, also a listed company and a top medication distributor in Viet Nam, to 32 per cent in 2018. The Finance Ministry is planning to remove restrictions on foreign ownership of State-owned and listed companies by the end of 2019, which is expected to open up more business and investment opportunities in health care.64 The Government has also issued other laws and implementation decrees to cut procedures and create more favourable conditions for investment in health care. For instance, the 2016 Law on Pharmacy waives requirements for clinical trials of new drugs except vaccines, provided that they have sufficient clinical data on safety and efficiency and are circulated in at least one country anywhere in the world.65 Investment incentives Investment incentives, in the form of tax incentives, tax holidays, exemption from import duties and exemption from or reduction of land rental, land-use levy or land use tax are provided for health care activities such as medical examination and treatment; production of medications and medication materials, major and essential drugs, preventive and curative drugs for social 239 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN diseases, vaccines, medical bioproducts, herbal medicines and oriental medicines, scientific research and biotechnology for producing new drugs.66 Tax incentives and tax holidays are also available to other health care activities.

In addition, depending on their location, such health care establishments can also enjoy tax holidays (four years of tax exemption and a subsequent five or nine years of 50 per cent tax reduction).67 Foreign investment in health care Foreign investors have been active in the health care industry in recent years. In 2018 alone, major deals in health care establishments include the acquisition by Sun Medical Center (Republic of Korea) of Nha Khoa My, an international network of dental clinics that has been operating in Viet Nam for 15 years. In anticipation of the Vietnam-Europe Free Trade Agreement, Adamed Group, Poland\u2019s second largest pharmaceutical group, acquired a 70 per cent stake in Davipharm for $50 million. Mergers and acquisitions have been used by foreign investors for immediate access to the local market. Aside from health care establishments, other foreign companies such as Mega Lifesciences (Thailand), DKSH and Zuellig Pharma (both Switzerland) are active in wholesale pharmaceutical activities. Foreign investment in health care is expected to increase because of market opening. The Government has set ambitious targets for the development of the health care industry to meet the growing demand and has also taken measures to encourage investment. It is promoting PPPs in national-scale hospital upgrade and construction projects, which opens up opportunities for private investment. 4.4.

Other technical issues (e.g. on medication, data protection and data security) need to be considered if harmonization is to transform ASEAN into a competitive medical hub. However, it is important to recognize that the commitment of Member States to the various MRAs and agreements on harmonization of regulatory issues are notable efforts to improve the business environment and to realize the AEC (health care) objectives. A lack of skills, technological capacity and human resources (doctors and other health care workers) continues to weigh on the development of the health care industry across the region. In some Member States, this limitation poses more serious challenges than in others. The emergence of new and more complex health care activities or products (biomedical, advanced medical technology) requires new talents and personnel with the right skill sets.

In some cases, a limited market and less developed ecosystem have made it a challenge to attract FDI. There are administrative challenges (in some Member States) in terms of transparency, clarity and streamlining of investment procedures and uncertainties in the implementation of laws and regulations on health care. Providing additional guidance and more clarity on new laws on foreign investments would help alleviate such concerns. The participation of more small and medium-sized enterprises in health care is needed. Such entities face barriers to entry more often than larger ones; examples of such barriers include regulatory challenges and limited access to finance and support for innovation. In regard to attracting private investment in medical technology, the region faces the challenge of a lack of experienced talent, focused capital and a nascent supporting industry. Although cooperation exists, competition in the region in medical tourism is growing. 4.5. POLICY OPTIONS AND WAYS FORWARD To address some of the challenges, the following policy options on investment facilitation, balancing regulation over innovation, coherence of policies in attracting FDI and developing a region-wide medical tourism hub could be considered (chapter 3). Investment facilitation Most Member States have liberal policies for investment in health care. Some are examining measures to support further opening up of the industry. Member States are actively promoting 243 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN and encouraging FDI in health care infrastructure (e.g. hospitals). And in most cases, they allow 100 per cent foreign equity ownership, including in health insurance. Streamlining of investment and administrative measures and procedures can further improve the investment environment. PPPs Given the limited public resources to meet the increasing"

However, deeper engagement with various private sector stakeholders from hospital groups to private equity investors could be considered.

One such mechanism could be an \u201cASEAN health care council\u201d involving private sector stakeholders to promote the development of an efficient and competitive health care environment. Regulatory issues Some regulatory issues also require attention. They include the following: Overregulation versus promoting innovation There is a need to regulate segments of the health care industry to protect patients and to direct development towards national and regional objectives. However, there is also a need to strike a balance between regulating and promoting innovation. Overregulating could stifle innovation, which is needed to advance the industry and improve efficiency in the delivery of care services. For instance, promoting digital health and ensuring data privacy. Regulations that stop the free flow of data could severely restrict the use of such data, which could stifle investments and development of the health care industry (e.g. tele-health and data analytics). Region-wide regulatory framework Some regulatory issues (aside from those covered under the existing ASEAN MRAs and AMDD) could be harmonized to facilitate cross-border investment in health care, where appropriate. Data protection As the industry moves towards greater digitalization, with EMRs in a digital data environment, there is a need to consider the issues of data ownership, data residency, and data protection and security in order to protect patients. A strong national and region-wide regulatory framework on these issues could be considered. Developing medical tourism Medical tourism is"

Although medical tourism is important, it should not be the primary 244 ASEAN Investment Report 2019 \u2013 FDI in Services: Focus on Health Care reason for investment in hospitals. The development of the health care industry should serve local patients. In addition to the local patient segment, medical tourism can make the market lucrative for private investors. Private investment in hospitals that targets only medical tourism does not offer a sustainable business model, as medical tourism revenues can fluctuate and be affected by global events such as recession or financial crises. Where promoting medical tourism is an important item on the economic agenda, it should be built on the basis of efficiency and through the development of a strong ecosystem, and it should involve an interplay of the various stakeholders (e.g. private hospitals, government institutions, health care enablers, transportation and logistics services, the hospitality industry and tourism boards). Recognizing the potential of the region for further growth in medical tourism and the positive externality effects of such tourism (e.g. returns on investment, arrest of \u201cbrain drains\u201d of doctors, financing of better equipment and training), an ASEAN medical tourism hub could be considered.69 The aim would be for Member States to cooperate to promote and develop ASEAN as a world medical tourism hub, drawing on the strengths, skill sets and capabilities of the Member States. Such regional cooperation to develop comprehensive health care solutions could bring complementary benefits and synergies to participating countries, including in supporting the objectives of the AEC.

Digitalization and medical technologies In regard to improving the capacity of countries to develop medical technology, Member States could work on developing an environment that is conducive for venture capital firms and start- ups to establish operations in the region. In promoting digital or e-health, the coherence of measures or agreements need to take into account existing agreements such as the ASEAN Agreement on Electronic Commerce, signed in 2018. Incentivizing SMEs There is a need to incentivize and motivate small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups to get involved in health care development, strengthening the ecosystem. Data limitation and data coverage Better data are needed to monitor the development of private investment in the health care industry. The provision of such data can help policymakers examine the significance of investment in health care across different value chain segments and can be of use in the design of policies to attract investment (e.g. in digital health and medical technologies). A task force 245 Chapter 4 Health Care Investment Environment and Policies in ASEAN could be established to identify and examine approaches in which better data and information could be extracted from existing reporting systems. Such health care data could be reported regularly to the ASEAN health ministers and economic ministers for use in policy development. 4.6. CONCLUSION The demand for health care in ASEAN is rising. Population growth, changing demographics, universal health care programmes and the rise in non-communicable diseases are pushing up demand for health care services. The public sector alone cannot meet the health care challenge. The private sector can play a role in complementing public efforts and supporting the development of a competitive health care industry.

With the growth in demand, the private sector could contribute through PPP activities and invest in health infrastructure, manufacturing of pharmaceutical and medical devices, and funding of health care start-ups. The investment environment in the region is improving. Key drivers are regional and national development. The former relates to regional cooperation and implementation of agreements relating to health care, including market opening and harmonization of standards and regulatory issues. The latter covers efforts to improve the investment environment, liberalize, commit to realizing universal health coverage and provide an efficient health care system, as well as to strengthen the PPP environment. ASEAN Member States have further opened up the health care market for FDI, where 100 per cent foreign equity ownership under the AFAS is allowed, and they are spending more on developing their health care systems. Investors and companies would do well to evaluate and understand the implications of the changing regional investment landscape, which offers opportunities across the health care spectrum. The region continues to offer investment opportunities, as ASEAN moves towards realizing the objectives of a single market, a competitive production base and a more deeply connected region by 2025. The significance of regional development and an integrated market of nearly 700 million people with a combined GDP of more than $4.7 trillion by 2025 cannot be underestimated. In moving forward to develop a competitive health care environment, existing challenges at the regional and national levels need to be addressed. Some policy options could be considered.

The manufacturing sector, which saw output expanding by 7.3% y-o-y, was the only sector that reported growth in 2020, reversing 2019\u2019s 1.5% y-o-y contraction. In contrast, construction output plunged by 35.9% y-o-y, after rising 1.6% y-o-y in 2019. The services producing industries also reported a 6.9% y-o-y fall in output in 2020, after expanding by 2.0% y-o-y in 2019. Advance estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (\u201cMTI\u201d) on 14 April 2021 showed the Singapore economy is on the mend after GDP posted a marginal uptick of 0.2% y-o-y in 1Q21, ending three consecutive quarters of contractions. The manufacturing sector which grew 7.5% y-o-y remained the primary growth driver, while both the construction and services producing industries recorded smaller y-o-y output declines in 1Q21. In its April 2021 monetary policy statement, the Monetary Authority of Singapore expects Singapore\u2019s 2021 GDP to exceed the upper end of MTI\u2019s forecast of between 4.0% and 6.0%. 2021\u2019s GDP growth is foreseen to be gradual and uneven due to downside risks such as the trajectory of the global economic recovery and the course that the COVID-19 pandemic will take. RECENT GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND MEASURES AFFECTING THE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY MARKET COVID-19 Support Measures In 2020, the Government of Singapore announced support packages with a total worth of approximately SGD 105 billion to help Singapore\u2019s businesses and individuals cope with the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The key COVID-19 support measures applicable to the industrial property sector, which have, to some extent, helped mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the industrial property market in 2020 are summarised in the table below.

Performance Key COVID-19 Support Measures for the Industrial Property Market Support Measure Details Rental Waivers/ Reliefs The intention of the rental relief framework is to help as many businesses as possible weather the COVID-19-related economic fallout through rental waivers borne by the government and landlords. Tenants continue to pay maintenance fees and service charges. Eligible industrial tenants in government-owned/managed facilities received a total of two months of rental waiver. Eligible small and medium-sized enterprise (\u201cSME\u201d) tenants in private industrial properties received one month of rent relief (supported by the government) for April 2020. This was made up of a 30% property tax rebate (equivalent to about 0.36 month of rent) and cash grant (about 0.64 month of rent). SME tenants who further qualified for the Additional Rental Relief received another month of rent relief for May 2020, borne by landlords. COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 On 7 April 2020, the Ministry of Law (\u201cMinLaw\u201d) passed the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 to offer temporary relief to businesses and individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Act took effect on the same day and has since been amended thrice in June, September and November 2020. The Act allows businesses and individuals to defer certain contractual obligations, such as paying rent, repaying loans or completing work, for a specified period. It also ensures that property owners pass on property tax rebates in full to tenants. On 12 October 2020, MinLaw announced the extension of the relief period under Part 2 of the Act, which enables parties"

The relief periods for selected contracts were extended further by MinLaw on 16 November 2020. Specifically, relief covering leases and licences of industrial properties ended on 19 November 2020, while the specified period for construction contracts or supply contracts was extended from 19 October 2020 to 31 March 2021. For Options to Purchase and Sale and Purchase Agreements between developers and purchasers of industrial properties, the prescribed relief period has been extended to 31 March 2021 to help industrial property buyers who require more time to make payments. It will also allow developers and purchasers to seek temporary protection from being sued during the relief period, if they are unable to perform any contractual obligations due to COVID-19. Jobs Support Scheme (\u201cJSS\u201d) The JSS was introduced to help save Singapore citizens\u2019 and permanent residents\u2019 jobs by providing wage support to employers during the period of economic uncertainty.

(See Table 2) ISLANDWIDE LOGISTICS/ WAREHOUSE MARKET OVERVIEW Existing Supply, Demand and Occupancy As of 1Q21, Singapore had 119.9 million sq ft of logistics/warehouse space, of which 97.6% was held by the private sector and 2.4% by the public sector. Due to COVID-19-related project delays, total net new supply was less than envisaged, amounting to only about 1.0 million sq ft in 2020, or less than a third of 2019\u2019s total net new supply of 3.2 million sq ft. On the other hand, demand for logistics/warehouse space was healthy, underpinned by renewals and increased activity involving short-term leases to accommodate medical and food supplies, as well as consumer items (e.g., from e-retailers) following a spike in Ecommerce activities and increased stockpiling requirements. For example, Ecommerce players such as RedMart, Shopee Express and J&T Express took up more warehouse space in 2020, while Zuellig Pharma Singapore expanded its existing office and warehouse space to cater to the growing healthcare needs of the local market. This contributed to the near tripling in net space absorption from 1.1 million sq ft in 2019 to 3.1 million sq ft in 2020, albeit still less than the ten-year (2010 to 2019) average of 3.7 million sq ft per annum. As total net space absorption exceeded total net space additions in 2020, the islandwide average logistics/ warehouse occupancy rate was lifted from 88.0% as of 4Q19, to 89.9% as of 4Q20 \u2013 its highest level in five years. Demand remained healthy in 1Q21, underpinned by requirements from firms in Ecommerce, medical-related and food storage/logistics businesses.

The EST will work with the six FEC Clusters (Manufacturing, Built Environment, Trade & Connectivity, Essential Domestic Services, Modern Services and Lifestyle) on their industry transformation strategies, considering the changes that COVID-19 will have on the global economy and on Singapore.1 In line with this, there are plans to promote Singapore\u2019s status as a regional and global Ecommerce hub. Besides introducing two nationwide 5G networks by 2025 to enable infrastructure capacity to deal with large online sales orders internationally, other key initiatives include working with businesses to build strong supply-chain capabilities, including developing value-added and specialised capabilities in areas such as cold-chain management, retail and pharmaceutical logistics.

Source: JTC, JLL Research Table 2 Overview Performance Governance Sustainability Financial 79 Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2020/2021 Potential Supply An estimated 7.9 million sq ft3 (net floor area) of new logistics/warehouse space is expected to be completed from 2Q 2021 to 2024, based on JTC\u2019s latest list of projects in the pipeline as of 1Q21 and JLL\u2019s research. Of this, JLL estimates that around 45.6% are single-user premises intended mostly for self-use, and 54.4% are multiple- user spaces. Without considering stock withdrawals and change of use, this will raise the islandwide stock as of 1Q21 by 6.6%, to around 128 million sq ft by end-2024. By expected year of completion, new supply is projected to surge to a peak of about 4.6 million sq ft in 2021 (inclusive of net additions in 1Q21) as COVID-19-related construction disruptions pushed back the completion of projects from 2020. Thereafter, new supply is foreseen to taper to 1.7 million sq ft and 1.1 million sq ft in 2022 and 2023, respectively, and to rise to 1.3 million sq ft in 2024. On average, the annual projected new supply of about 2.2 million sq ft from 2021 (full year) to 2024 is around half the average annual net new supply of 4.3 million sq ft witnessed in the four years from 2017 to 2020. (See Exhibit 2 and Table 3) 3 Potential supply includes space under construction and planned.

Rents Despite the improvement in the average islandwide logistics/ warehouse occupancy rate, JTC\u2019s warehouse rental index, which is based on private warehouse transactions, fell for the seventh consecutive year in 2020. While the 1.3% y-o-y fall in the rental index was steeper than the 0.9% and 0.2% declines in 2018 and 2019, respectively, it was milder than the 1.6% to 6.4% declines from 2014 to 2017. This was even though 2020 saw Singapore experiencing its worst economic recession since independence, indicating the resilience in rent. In line with the improving economy and sustained healthy demand, JTC\u2019s warehouse rental index rose by 0.5% from 4Q20 to 1Q21. According to data from J-Space, the islandwide 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile warehouse rents of leasing transactions in 1Q21 stood at SGD 1.40, SGD 1.80 and SGD 2.45 per sq ft per month, respectively. (See Exhibit 3) Prices JTC has not published the warehouse price index since 4Q14 due to the limitations posed by minimal transaction activity.

However, there is potential that stockpiling requirements will taper off when the COVID-19 situation stabilises or is contained. More efficient operations from automated warehouses could also lower the need to expand physical real estate footprints to cater to business expansion. Considering the above and the foreseen economic recovery in 2021, we expect Singapore\u2019s quantum of occupied logistics/warehouse stock to continue rising in 2021. However, the surge in new logistics/warehouse supply in 2021 could weigh down the islandwide average occupancy rate and cap rent growth in 2021. For the medium-term, we expect the projected economic and manufacturing sector growth to lend support to logistics/ warehouse demand. As new supply is expected to be low, this should underpin rent growth. March 2021 Meanwhile, the transformation of the logistics industry is expected to gather momentum as more firms embrace Industry 4.0 practices and adopt automation and the Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) in preparation for the eventual post-COVID-19 rebound.

Affected by the pandemic and global lockdowns, which in turn hindered both air and sea freight, Hong Kong\u2019s total exports of goods recorded a contraction of 2.8% year-on-year (\u201cy-o-y\u201d) in the first eleven months of 2020, while imports of goods fell by 5.0% over the same period. As one of the four pillars of the economy, trading and logistics accounted for 21.6% of GDP in terms of basic prices in 2019. (See Exhibit 1) Economic Forecasts According to FocusEconomics, Hong Kong\u2019s real GDP will continue to decline by 2.5% in Q4/2020, before rebounding to positive growth from Q1/2021 onwards.

The more positive economic outlook for 2021 is based on a recovery in consumer demand due to gradual virus containment, as well as a more stable business environment when the border subsequently reopens later in the year. Any reversal of the virus situation or a revival of social unrest would call into question the positive outlook. COVID-19 Impact The outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 has evolved into a worldwide pandemic with a negative economic impact globally. According to the World Bank, the global economy contracted by 4.3% in 2020. The retail and hospitality sectors in Hong Kong were hardest hit, with retail sales plummeting by 25.3% over the first eleven months of 2020, while visitor arrivals plunged by 93.2% over the same period due to border closures, leading to a 60% decline in RevPAR across all hotels in Hong Kong. Against this backdrop, the local logistics sector was relatively unscathed with a moderate decline of 1.5% and 3.3% respectively in both total exports and imports reported in 2020. The various social distancing measures implemented as well as the emerging work-from-home (\u201cWFH\u201d) trend have accelerated ecommerce demand locally, with ecommerce revenue up by 32% in 2020 compared to a moderate growth rate of 22% in 2019, according to Statista. With surgical masks in high demand in the first half of 2020 and the dine-in prohibition after 6pm in place for most of the year, it came as no surprise that Food & Personal Care was the fastest growing category in 2020, registering a 43% y-o-y increase.

The overall stock distribution of warehouses shows a clear shift of warehouse facilities towards the northwest New Territories over the past two decades. Compared with 1994, Hong Kong Island and Kwun Tong warehouse stock declined by 26% and 25% respectively to 1.8 and 2.8 million sq ft IFA in 2019. However, stock in Tuen Mun / Yuen Long rose sharply from 1.4 million sq ft IFA in 1994 to 2.9 million sq ft IFA in 2019, a 104% increment. This shift was driven by the development of new infrastructure such as Container Terminal 9, HKIA, the River Trade Terminal, the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, being completed over the period.

Overall vacancy increased to 2.2% in Q4/2019 from a recent low of 1.2% in Q2/2018 due mainly to the recent US / China trade tensions which derailed the trading economy, as well as the social unrest which has affected inbound tourism from China with negative consequences for the local retail market and its associated logistics demand. Following the COVID-19 outbreak since the start of 2020, global supply chain has been disrupted with increasing difficulty to move cargoes around, thereby affecting the freight forwarding and cross-border distribution functions of logistics operators. As visitor arrivals dwindle due to border closure and with more social distancing measures implemented, the retail market suffered. The 3PLs serving the retail market were faced with slowing businesses, leading to shrinking warehouse space demand which pushed overall warehouse vacancy up to 4.1% in Q4/2020, before falling heavily back to 3.1% in Q1/2021 due to improving macros and major leasing deals being recorded. Against this backdrop, modern warehouse vacancy rose to 2.8% in Q4/2020 from 0.9% in Q4/2019, but declined slightly to 2.7% in Q1/2021 following an increasing number of renewals driven by proactive landlords reducing rents.

Looking into 2021 and beyond, while the virus situation remains unpredictable, forecasted revival in global logistics; a potential rebound in the local retail market; rising ecommerce demand; and newly completed infrastructure should all contribute to brighter prospects for the local logistics market. This could lead to a potential rental rebound from Q2 onwards, following a stabilisation in the warehouse market in Q1. Modern warehouses are expected to benefit most as their specifications are more suitable to ecommerce operators and multinational 3PLs. We expect modern warehouse rents to rebound by 5% to 10% in 2021, while overall warehouses may see slower growth with higher vacancy. Areas benefiting from newly completed infrastructure, such as Liantang / Heung Yuen Wai Border Control Point in the North- eastern New Territories, as well as Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link linking up Tuen Mun South and Hong Kong International Airport, should also see improving demand prospects. Modern warehouses, which continued to record a 30% premium over overall rents in Q4/2020, have a brighter outlook in light of growth from cross- border ecommerce and the structural shift towards air freight and high value-added goods. As operational efficiencies and modern facilities are increasingly more crucial in the logistics sector, rents for modern warehouses are expected to post a relatively stronger performance compared to the overall market during the next four years. Variations in supply, though, will limit rental growth for modern warehouses in 2023 to 0%, will only be temporary. (See Table"

Most of these demand groups require large floor plates, high ceiling heights and extra floor loadings, which can only be found in modern warehouses located in strategic locations either close to the airport, container terminals, the border, or a combination of all. As these operators are often handling higher value goods in large volumes, they are willing to pay premium rents to acquire warehouses which suit their needs, thereby reaffirming the rental premiums of modern warehouses over their general counterparts. March 2021 subsequently the pandemic, have led to declining logistics demand, dampening modern warehouse rental growth in both 2019 and 2020. Renewals were more common in modern warehouses, as these corporate landlords, who are experienced at managing large portfolios, have been more proactive in reducing rents since the second half of last year due to the increasingly difficult operating environment. At the end of Q1/2021, average modern warehouse rents stood at HK$13.0 per sq ft gross, a 12.1% downward adjustment from Q2/2019. General warehouses, which are mainly owned by local individual landlords / industrialists, were slower in terms of marking their asking rents to market. At the end of Q1/2021, average overall warehouse rents stood at HK$10.9 per sq ft gross, a 10.5% decline from Q2/2019.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China\u2019s real GDP grew by 2.3% year-on- year (\u201cYOY\u201d) in 2020 despite some volatility in the first quarter of 2020 due to the lockdown measures in face of the pandemic. With successful epidemic control alongside a series of economic stimulus measures and strong economic fundamentals, a fast recovery was seen in the second to fourth quarters. The fast rebound has allowed the country to emerge as an outlier among large economies at a time when the global economy was upended by the pandemic. Total imports and exports grew by 1.9% YOY while trade surplus recorded an expansion of 27.1% YOY. Factories in China promptly resumed operations once the coronavirus was largely stamped out whereas manufacturing activities worldwide were disrupted as the pandemic spreads to the rest of the world. This enabled China to produce and export mass quantities of medical and work-from-home equipment, which generated keen logistics demand.

In pursuit of sustainable long- term economic growth, The PRC\u2019s economic rebalancing in recent years has led to a shift from an export- led to a domestic-driven economy. As a result, domestic consumption has become a key growth engine for the country. In 2020, domestic consumption accounted for 54.3% of The PRC\u2019s economic growth, and continues to be the major driving force of economic growth for the seventh consecutive year. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, cities were placed under lockdown and the operation of most physical retail stores were suspended in the first quarter of 2020. As a result, it accelerated the growing trend of online shopping. Online retail sales rose by 10.9% YOY in 2020 against the backdrop of a 3.9% YOY contraction in overall retail sales. Consequently, online retail sales of physical goods as a proportion of overall retail sales increased to 24.9%, from 20.7% last year. The resurgence of coronavirus in some places poses uncertainties to the economic recovery of The PRC; however, the economy of The PRC remains optimistic especially after its extraordinary achievement in 2020 amid challenging times. According to the International Monetary Fund, the GDP of The PRC is expected to see a noticeable growth of 8.1% in 2021, outpacing the global GDP growth of 5.5%. The economy of The PRC remains resilient ahead supported by continued urbanisation and a rising middle class.

As a result, consumers had no choice but to shift their consumption from offline to online. From daily necessities to high-end commodity goods, almost everything can be purchased online and this accelerated the growing trend of online shopping. While physical stores gradually began to resume normal operations following the containment of the COVID-19 virus, it is expected that a relatively strong growth in ecommerce will still continue amid increasing emphasis on social distancing. As online shopping becomes the trend, it also implies a sustainable demand for warehouses from the ecommerce sector. Rise of 3PLs While some ecommerce companies have their own logistics arms, most, if not all, still tend to outsource their logistics operations to 3PL service providers as it is more cost-effective. Revenue growth of 3PL service providers is evident from an increasing proportion of budget attributable to 3PL services by ecommerce retailers, which has risen from 66.0% in 2015 to 73.0% in 2020. Moreover, according to the State Post Bureau of The PRC, the annual volume of express delivery has risen to over 83 billion pieces in 2020, up by 31.2% YOY. 3PL firms definitely benefitted from a surge in demand for online shopping and medical goods, and witnessed a boost in revenues during this period.

Travel restrictions in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic had also led to severe disruptions to the supply chains in the beginning of 2020. Since then, many companies worldwide have started to revisit their inventory management strategies. In order to minimise disruption risk from geographical uncertainties, companies are considering a switch from the traditional just-in-time strategy, which strives to keep as little inventory as possible, to the just-in-case strategy, which relies on having surplus inventory. For instance, Parkson Retail Group Limited, which manages a network of department stores and retail operations across 27 cities in The PRC, recorded an inventory growth of 16% YOY in the first half of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Consequently, Japan\u2019s economy shrank 4.0% over the full year, its first contraction since 2009.

Despite COVID-19 bringing almost all economic activity to a standstill in the first half of 2020, demand for warehouse continued to outpace annual supply. Annual supply nationwide was approximately 3,820,000 m2, while demand was approximately 4,110,000 m2. The pre-commitment rate for the following year\u2019s supply as at end 2020 was 57%1, a sharp increase as compared to 43% a year ago. (See Exhibit 1) While the logistics industry enjoyed a boom in 2018 and 2019 which led to a strong demand for logistics real estate, the industry was negatively impacted by COVID-19 in 2020. However, the impact was mitigated by a pick-up in demand from Ecommerce. Consequently, in all four major areas of Greater Tokyo, Greater Osaka, Greater Nagoya and Fukuoka, vacancy rates of large-scale leased logistics facilities remain low, while rents continued to trend up. - Reasons behind vigorous demand Demand is driven by advance leasing from Ecommerce-related companies and leasing from manufacturer shippers who are consolidating premises, as well as continued leasing demand from 3PL providers. Ecommerce is the most significand demand driver, with Ecommerce-related demand expected to account for about 30% of total demand in 2020 and 2021, up from around 10% in 2019. - Reasons behind increase in supply Nationwide,"

Supply Factors - Differentiation between developed facilities In response to the rising number of developed properties, developers are proactively introducing differentiation to their properties. In addition to tangible differentiation such as the adoption of seismically isolated and damping structures, special design of exterior walls, provision of day-care facilities and other amenities for employees (such as clean restrooms), effort is now being put into intangible differentiation through services that provide solutions to issues faced by tenants, such as human resource referrals, truck standby systems, and consultancy on installation of material handling equipment within a facility. Such approaches are mainly adopted by large-scale developed properties and developed properties with multiple buildings, while small- and medium-sized stand-alone developed properties focus on provision of modern-spec functionalities. - Expansion of radius for potential development sites A rate of JPY 3,500 to 3,800 per tsubo per month is the rent level that 3PL providers consider as reasonable. Rising rents in the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas are making it more difficult to secure rental space within this range, especially in areas close to the city center. In response to the needs of 3PL providers, developers are expanding the radius for potential development sites further into the suburbs, mainly along expressways.

Supply is also projected to be the largest ever in the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas. In 2020, bids were sought for sites eligible for development all around the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas and developers made the most of their individual networks to acquire sites. Given this situation, supply is likely to continue to be high at about 5,000,000 m2 or more for some time. Outlook for Demand Supported by demand from Ecommerce related businesses, demand for logistics real estate is expected to remain firm and likely to keep pace with the high level of supply. The pre-commitment rate3 for 2021 as at the end of 2020 was about 57% on a nationwide basis, with high rates of 52% in the Greater Tokyo area and 72% in the Osaka area.

Viewed by product type, food and beverage products have a low penetration rate of 2.89%, while household furniture, books, sundry household goods, office supplies, etc. have higher penetration rates of 20% to 40%. Outlook for Supply-Demand Balance (See Exhibit 5) - Outlook for 2021 With a high pre-commitment rate and the expected growth in Ecommerce-related demand, there is unlikely to be an extreme deterioration in the supply-demand balance, even if macroeconomic weakness continues to impact the logistics industry. Overall rental rates are expected to hold steady or firm up, especially for the prime locations. - 2022 and Beyond In the short term, Ecommerce related demand is expected to grow and sustain demand for logistics facilities. However, there remains uncertainties over the pace of economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the longer term, it is likely to arise relocation demands due to aging of the existing warehouses. Trends in the Logistics Real Estate Market in the Main Economic Zones Greater Tokyo area The vacancy rate continued its downward trend since 2015, falling to approximately 1.3% by the end of 2020. The supply-demand balance is tight, and pre-commitment on developed properties prior to their completion is growing as the shortage of vacant space intensifies. In 2020, supply of approximately 2,660,000 m2 was met with demand of approximately 2,830,000 m2, as demand continues to strengthen further. In areas where large-scale development is taking place, such as Sagamihara and Nagareyama districts, and even for properties with high rents, leasing was buoyant. In the bayside area and inland areas around Atsugi, Kashiwa and Tokyo, vacancy rates have remained low while rents have risen dramatically over 2020. Looking ahead, supply in 2021 is projected to exceed that for 2020 and may be the largest ever. Despite the"

It is likely that rents will continue to rise firmly in many districts. On the other hand, new development properties which try to capture demands from other regions or properties which set higher rent than market, leasing activities are likely to be very competitive, in result more properties may offer a generous range of incentives. Osaka area A limited supply in 2018 through 2020 coupled with strong demand led to a decline in vacancy rate to 3.9% by the end of 2020. In the inland area where demand is strong, the vacancy rate is 0%. While supply is expected to be the largest ever in 2021, pre-commitment rate has reached 72%. In the inland area, vacancy rates hovered at nearly 0% from 2018 through 2020. Against this background, rents have remained firm. With road improvements such as the Shin-Meishin Expressway and Second Keihan Highway, there is a rapid expansion of the radius within which logistics facilities are being developed. In the bayside area, there are signs of demand returning due to the widening difference in rent compared with the inland area and the shortage of vacant space in the inland area. The supply-demand balance in Osaka, which was for a time seen as a high-risk area due to oversupply, has tightened in recent years. Although supply in 2021 is projected to be the largest ever, the pre-commitment rate is quite high, so there is limited likelihood that the supply-demand balance will deteriorate markedly.

Although there is unrealised potential in Ecommerce- related demand, demand conditions are slightly different from those in the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas.

However, the increase in supply projected for 2022 and beyond may lead to a deterioration in the supply-demand balance. Rents may plateau or, in the medium term, even soften. Other areas - Sendai metropolitan area The scale of demand in the Sendai metropolitan area is relatively small, at about 1/20 that of the Greater Tokyo area. Ongoing demand for warehouse is driven by the reconstruction of the region following the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. The development of facilities continued in inland areas such as Izumi, Tomiya and Medeshimadai in Natori City. This was followed by a resurgent increase in developments in seaside areas. Built-to-suit (BTS) developments are numerous in this area, but there are also multi-tenant facilities. However, reconstruction demand has weakened recently, while rents are also plateauing. - Sapporo metropolitan area Within the Sapporo metropolitan area, Sapporo City and surrounding districts are promising areas for logistics facilities. Development was previously limited to only built-to- suit in this area, but development of multi-tenant facilities in Higashikariki and Wattsu industrial park is gathering pace. As demand is likely to keep pace with supply, overall rent level is expected to be stable. - Hiroshima metropolitan area In the Hiroshima metropolitan area, the existing multi-tenant facilities are located in Itsukaichi and Nishi-ku, Demand for logistics space around Nishi-ku (the area adjacent to Shoko Center) is high, even as rents are on the high side (about JPY 4,000 per tsubo), leading to low"

March 2021 Performance Independent Market Research Japan by Japan Logistics Field Institute, Inc. 96 Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2020/2021 South Korea by Colliers MARKET ANALYSIS Resilient Domestic Growth Despite Global Challenges In times of pandemic crisis and the global downturn in 2020, South Korea\u2019s economy withstood relatively well compared to other developed nations. The economy recorded a marginal negative growth of 1.0% YOY in 2020, outperforming the majority of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) countries, as its large manufacturing industry, well-established online shopping base, and pandemic-response measures buoyed its economy. Modest quarter- on-quarter(\u201cQOQ\u201d) declines of -1.3% and -3.2% in the first two quarters of 2020 were subsequently followed by two strong quarters of recovery at 2.1% and 1.2% QOQ growth. As of year-end 2020, South Korea has ranked the top tenth largest economy across the globe in terms of gross domestic product, surpassing Brazil, Italy, and Russia. The relatively positive outlook of South Korea\u2019s economy has attracted foreign investors looking for investment opportunities in a resilient market. Amid the economic downturn, government spending has risen significantly in an attempt to keep the economy afloat. In 2020, the government increased its budgeted spending by KRW66.8 trillion (USD59.9 billion) through four rounds of supplementary budgets. This is the first time in nearly 60 years that the government initiated four rounds of supplementary budgets in a single year. The government has allocated a total budget of KRW277 trillion in financial stimulus packages to boost the virus-hit economy. The government\u2019s fiscal support is expected to continue through 2021. In December 2020, the National Assembly approved the 2021 budget of KRW558 trillion, a 9% increase on"

Ecommerce and Grade A Logistics Facilities Benefit During Pandemic The demand for modern logistics properties continues to be strong, mainly driven by the robust growth of the Ecommerce sector. Total Ecommerce volume reached KRW159 trillion in 2020, an increase of approximately 16.7% year-on-year (\u201cYOY\u201c), and accounting for about one- third of total retail sales volume. This comes after the Ecommerce market surged at an annual growth rate of 20% or higher during 2016 and 2019. Of particular note, mobile sales have expanded dramatically at a compound annual growth rate (\u201cCAGR\u201d) of 49% from 2013 to 2020. The prolonged pandemic and social distancing measures have changed the market as well. Annual contactless deliveries of fresh foods and services and home appliances saw 53% and 44% YOY growth in 2020, respectively. This demands faster delivery times and therefore leads to quicker turnover of goods and higher utilisation rate of logistics facilities. In order to cater to the growing online demand, major retailers are restructuring their business models. Naver, one of the two major internet platform providers in South Korea, partnered with CJ Logistics to expand its online sales within the platform; while Amazon also entered the market partnering with SK Telecom."

Existing Stock and Future Pipeline in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) In recent years, there have been more developments of sizeable and high- quality logistics facilities to meet the needs of occupiers (logistics service providers and retailers). According to the Building Registry of Korea and Colliers research, 25 new logistics warehouses were added in the SMA during 2020, amounting to about 1.7 million sq m. As at the end of 2020, logistics centres located in the SMA provided about 21.3 million sq m of gross floor area, representing about 8% CAGR over the past ten years. Total stock in the SMA is expected to grow by another 1.7 million sq m and 2.4 million sq m in 2021 and 2022, respectively. However, the number of expected developments has decreased from previous years, indicating a smaller number of developments but with a larger scale. As location becomes increasingly more important to enable faster deliveries, traditional logistics hub cities located in Southeast Gyeonggi- do near major highways continue to be the top priority for developers, accounting for nearly 37% of the total stock in the SMA.

Supported by strong demand for modern facilities, certain Grade A developments completed in 2020 were also able to either secure tenants for 100% of space during the pre-leasing stage prior to completion or keep absorption period to within one quarter upon its completion.

Australia\u2019s economic growth had been fostered by low interest rates and the depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013, therefore driving higher export volumes. The COVID-19 containment measures led to a sharp drop in Australia\u2019s GDP over 2Q20 (-7.0%), leading to Australia\u2019s first recession since 1991, following a 0.3% decline in 1Q20. However, the economy rebounded strongly in second half of the year on the back of the government\u2019s unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus programmes. Income support policies (such as the JobKeeper program \u2013 extended to March 2021, and JobSeeker) have supported consumption expenditure, particularly within the non- discretionary retail sector and online retail platform. Australia\u2019s fiscal policy response to COVID-19 has been one of the highest in the world (11.5% of GDP). The 2020-21 Federal Budget further provides economic stimulus, mainly in the form"

GDP of Australia\u2019s major trading partners is forecast to grow by around 6% in 2021 and 4% in 2022. As a result of the various policy support measures and the successful management of the health crisis, Australia\u2019s GDP growth projection is expected to rebound in 2021. According to the Reserve Bank of Australia (\u201cRBA\u201d) in its November 2020 release: GDP growth is forecast to increase to 6% by June 2021 then slightly fall to 5% by the end of 2021. Unemployment rate is forecast to marginally decline to 7.5% in mid- 2021 and trend downwards to 6.5% by the end of 2021. Underlying inflation is expected to increase from -0.3% in June 2020 to 2.25% in June 2021. Over the long-term, two of the most relevant economic variables that global real estate investors refer to for benchmarking Australia to other global economies are: GDP and population growth. The longer-term economic and population growth outlook is favourable for Australia relative to other mature economies. Oxford Economics projects Australia\u2019s GDP growth will average 2.8% per annum between 2020 and 2030 \u2013 well above the economic growth rate for most other mature economies. In the short-term, Australia\u2019s population growth will be negatively impacted by international border closures.

INDUSTRIAL AND LOGISTICS SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND TREND The Australian industrial and logistics sector, albeit impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, is supported by very strong property fundamentals including low vacancies, limited speculative development activity, relatively strong occupier demand, and growing investor appetite. These fundamentals will continue to drive the resilient performance of industrial and logistics assets. Pricing for core assets with strong covenants and long WALEs is expected to remain firm, while demand for secondary grade assets with leasing vulnerabilities is comparatively lower. The sector has been the most resilient of the mainstream commercial property sectors amid COVID-19. The resilience of the industrial & logistics sector is largely explained by high quality covenants in institutional grade assets and confidence in the ability to collect income. Industrial & logistics rent collection rates have remained high across most mature economies. The industrial & logistics sector has shown low volatility of returns through the cycle (rolling five-year average). In the COVID-19 economic downturn, return volatility remained low and has not experienced the same upward movement as the retail and, to a lesser extent, office sectors. (See Exhibit 1) The sector is exposed to a diverse range of growth drivers. A number of these factors were evident and having a positive influence even prior to COVID-19. COVID-19 has accelerated some of these existing growth trends for the industrial and logistics sector in 2020. Growth sectors backed by strong fundamentals include transport and logistics, eCommerce, food logistics and manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals. The structural eCommerce tailwind is relatively immature in Australia and is expected to further fuel the trajectory of growth. The share of online retail trade to total retail trade currently stands at 13.2% (as at February 2021, according to NAB), which is a significant jump from 9.3% in January 2020."

JLL projects the national Gross State Product-weighted Industrial & Logistics rent index will increase by 3.4% per annum from 2022 to 2029. It is important to put this rate of growth in the context of a low inflation environment. Deloitte Access Economics forecasts Australia\u2019s underlying CPI will be 2.3% between 2020 and 2029. (See Exhibit 8) The risks to the inflation outlook are to the downside as CPI has only averaged 1.5% per annum over the past four years (2017 to 2020). Therefore, the Australian Industrial & Logistics sector has the potential to deliver real (inflation-adjusted) rental growth of between 100 and 150 basis points over the next 10 years. Industrial property has emerged as a mature, institutional grade investment sector, and plays a vital role in a diversified portfolio. The Australian industrial sector remains one of the most sought-after sectors, by both domestic, regional and global capital sources, as it is underpinned by stable long-term factors. In 2020, approximately AUD 4.4 billion in investment sales occurred nationally (for sales AUD 10 million and over), illustrating the resilience of the sector during the pandemic period.

Given the significant economic uncertainty in the market during much of last year, most developers were unwilling or unable to commence any non-committed projects. The dynamic has now created a short-term lag in new asset delivery, which will be remedied throughout 2021 in line with the re-commencing of new projects towards the end of last year. The development pipeline in the Melbourne industrial & logistics market is expected to continue to deliver above-average volumes of stock. We are currently tracking 696,570 sqm of new stock, which is either under construction or has approved plans and due to complete over the balance of 2021. Assuming these projects all reach completion at their currently scheduled times, 2021 will mark the highest volume of completions in the Melbourne market that JLL research has recorded. (See Exhibit 14) Prime Rents Melbourne is one of the most affordable industrial & logistics markets in Australia. Average prime rents are at AUD 94 psm p.a., unchanged over 2020, while secondary net rents were AUD 74 psm p.a. Record levels of occupier activity has started to place upward pressure on rental values in the Melbourne market, with average rates increasing by 0.9% (prime) and 0.4% (secondary) in 1Q21. Melbourne\u2019s long-term prospects for strong population growth will continue to be a fundamental driver of growth for the industrial and logistics sector. As such, we have upgraded our rental growth forecasts for 2021 for Melbourne, with expectations of full- year growth of between 1-3%. Beyond 2021, we are forecasting growth to rebound to 2.0%-3.0% per annum over the medium term, underpinned by Melbourne\u2019s strong fundamentals. Exhibit 13 Source: JLL Research. As at 1Q21.

Yield Observations The long-term confidence of investors in the Melbourne market is evidenced by the further compression of yields in both the prime and secondary space. The average prime yield midpoint sharpened by 77 bps to a record low of 4.31% - 279 bps below the previous cyclical low \u2013 while the average secondary yield midpoint fell by 108 bps to 5.13%, also a record low.

The Southern precinct is the largest (5.7 million sqm), incorporating the city fringe and the land-rich area south of Brisbane. The precinct has become better serviced by road and rail infrastructure over the last 10 years, resulting in a higher share of demand- led development activity. Demand Gross annual take-up in 2020 totalled 384,200 sqm, which is below the 10- year annual average of 448,600 sqm.

Early signs in 2021 suggest that the occupier market in Brisbane is beginning to recover, with first quarter totals in line with long-term averages for the first time in 12 months. Given that leasing volumes in the market are typically lower in the first quarter of the year, 1Q21 results are 18% above the 10-year first quarter average. Supply A total of 416,600 sqm of industrial floorspace was delivered in 2020, well above the 10-year annual average of 274,700 sqm. While 2020 was a significant year for new supply, the bulk of development activity was demand- led with over 75% pre-leased prior to practical completion. Like other markets, Brisbane recorded a record-low volume of completions in 1Q21. Only two projects, totaling 12,800 sqm of floorspace delivered in the first three months of 2021.

Measures such as travel restrictions, enforced business closures and restricted social activities curbed domestic activities, while businesses also had to contend with a sharp slowdown in external demand. The fresh wave of COVID-19 pandemic since September 2020 led to a sharp economic contraction in the fourth quarter with gross domestic product (GDP) shrinking by 3.4% in the fourth quarter, compared to -2.6% in the third quarter.

As the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines gets underway, more business activities and services sector are allowed to reopen during the current phase of MCO 2.0 subject to conditions and standard operating procedures (SOPs) set by the relevant authorities. (See Exhibit 1) Malaysia registered a deflation (-1.2%) in 2020, the first time in five decades, primarily due to lower global oil and commodity prices coupled with tiered electricity tariff rebate since April 2020 and suppressed domestic demand amongst other factors. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has projected that headline inflation will average higher to 2.5% in 2021, mainly due to improved global oil prices. The central bank cut the overnight policy rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 1.75% on 7 July 2020, its fourth revision in 2020 to provide a more accommodative monetary environment to support the country\u2019s economy.

The COVID-19 outbreak, which led to the implementation of various stages of MCO with stringent SOPs such as physical (social) distancing, temperature screenings and hygiene guidelines amongst others, have accelerated the sales of consumer goods through online channels with many late adopters of ecommerce trying out online shopping. Subsequently, retailers have also jumped onto the ecommerce bandwagon, increasing their online presence and reducing the presence of physical stores. Evidently, F&N has launched its own ecommerce site as well as smartphone application allowing its consumers to purchase its products at bulk and at competitive prices online. Ecommerce reconfigure the supply chain flows allowing goods to be distributed to the end-users directly from the warehouses / distribution centres, bypassing the physical stores. Meanwhile, Mastercard has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with MDEC on 2 September 2020 in a collaborative effort to enable ecommerce for micro, small-and- medium enterprises (MSMEs), on top of fostering financial inclusion in rural communities. Under the collaboration, Mastercard will work together with MDEC to support industry partners and facilitate the rollout of Mastercard payments and business technologies giving MSMEs the ready-made infrastructure they need, to kick-start in ecommerce. The exponential growth of ecommerce increases the demand for warehousing in more locations including non- central locations to serve the rural communities. The emerging trends also encourage logistics players to increase efficiency by digitalizing their operations and this has led to higher demand for smart warehousing and e-fulfilment centres. Presently, the logistics industry in Malaysia is fragmented with a large number of players across the value chain. Moving forward, we expect to see more vertical and horizontal consolidation among the logistics and ecommerce players"

Another issue the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront is the concern surrounding supply chain security given how the supply of goods, material and labour were disrupted when the Chinese borders closed, severely hindering manufacturing output across the Asia-Pacific region. These concerns are not new as larger firms have started adopting a China- Plus-One model in recent years, where manufacturing operations are diversified out of the Chinese Mainland into more cost-effective markets such as Malaysia. Many smaller and medium sized enterprises, however, were caught off-guard when the pandemic hit. However, over the coming years, manufacturing reliance is set to shift away from the Chinese Mainland, and regions such as Southeast Asia and its industrial sector are set to be net beneficiaries.

VIETNAM WAREHOUSE MARKET In recent years, Vietnam\u2019s industrial and warehouse market has benefited from the US-China trade war. The Covid-19 pandemic has also compelled companies to consider new locations to re-configure and diversify their supply chains to mitigate risks. These developments have underscored Vietnam\u2019s attractiveness to foreign investors, due to its competitive advantage in areas such as favorable demographics, enhanced economic integration, preferential incentives from supportive government policies, an improving business environment and legal framework as well as rapid infrastructure improvements. This has resulted in total registered foreign direct investment (\u201cFDI\u201d) capital increasing by 8% p.a. on average over the past ten years. The increase in FDIs and manufacturing investments in Vietnam, together with the positive knock-on effects on domestic consumption and economic growth, have underpinned demand for logistics space.

This may result in more built-to-suit projects in the future, as compared to the current market preference for ready-built facilities. In the next two years, the market outlook remains positive with low vacancy and high rentals expected. However, rent growth is expected to moderate due to the consolidation of scattered warehousing portfolios, in addition to the significant addition of supply from new players like Logos, JD Property, NP/ Gaw, Cainiao Alibaba and developers like Unidepot. Cross docking and built-to-suit will be the trend for the coming years. With Vietnam\u2019s strategy to develop more value added and high-tech manufacturing, the quality and ability to provide just-in-time logistics services will become increasingly critical in the future. To cope with such evolving demands from clients, local 3PL landlords could look for value added partners.

Market Price Development The medium and long-term expectation remains that the demand for cold storage capacity in Vietnam will continue to grow significantly in years to come. The management of ACS expect that in 2024, the market will turn back to growth and the cold storage capacity in general will be utilized and the prices consequently will gradually return to the pre-Covid levels. Experienced a decline in its overall export in 2023 due to external market factors reducing consumers purchasing power and shift in consumption in the US and Europe and other key export markets. The logistic sector has been impacted by this with temporarily lower demand and lower capacity utilization of up to 40% followed by fierce price competition and similarly lower prices for storage services. This has impacted Vietnam\u2019s export and led to temporary reduction of activity in its export manufacturing sector. As a consequence, Vietnamese consumer incomes have fallen slightly with lower consumer demand for imported food among other products.

Cold Storage Price Projection \uf0a7 From 2019 to 2023, the pricing experienced a decline due to the lower market demand during Covid pandemic and economic crisis. \uf0a7 However, with the growing demand for imported food and the limited supply due to the extended construction period of new cold storage facilities (construction takes 2-3 years for a medium-sized facility), it is anticipated that the market price will experience an upward trend in the coming years. \uf0a7 As the demand gradually rises and the construction of new warehouses lags behind, it is anticipated that the price will start to pick up from 2025. \uf0a7 The price growth is expected to stabilize from 2027 onward at the annual growth of 3%, as the supply of cold storage facilities will catch up with the growing demand.

At the same time, large supply makes it the region with the second highest supply after the traditional logistics region, the Southeast. Incheon has ongoing development concentrated around industrial complexes, rather than residential areas, drawing fewer civil complaints compared to other areas. However, the wave of incoming cold storage supply brings us concern about rising vacancy in Incheon.

The Bank of Korea raised its base rate to 2.25% in July and has announced they are considering further rate hikes due to concerns about inflation. As the base interest rate rose, interest rate on loans also rose sharply. Commercial real estate mortgage loan interest rates, which stood at about 2% until 2021, rose to about the 4% level at the beginning of 2022, while the Project Finance loan rate has risen to 5%. As interest rates rise, investor sentiment is turning more conservative. In addition, investors are actively seeking ways to raise capital through equity rather than loans. 2022 logistics transaction volume expected to decrease YOY In 2021, the total logistics asset transaction volume in the Seoul Metropolitan Area recorded a new record high of KRW7 trillion. In addition, the sales price of logistics centers increased as more investment capital moves into cold storage assets.

An upward trend in the cap rate, which had been on a downward trend, has been observed since the second half of this year. From the beginning of 2022, when interest rates started to increase, cap rates flattened out, and have been flat since. This is in part due to increased logistics supply, and increased competition from investors. Simultaneously, the 5-year Korean Treasury Bond interest rate has risen sharply, and the risk premium spread has narrowed to be almost non-existent. In the future, we expect cap rates to rise and asset prices to decrease if the logistics center transaction size decreases followed by an increase in interest rates and construction costs. However, rising cap rates are not assured as sales prices have seen little decline thus far. Source: Colliers. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 BPS Spread Average"

From 2015 to May 2022, according to Statistics Korea, the Construction Costs Index went up about 46% to 146.38 from a base of 100. According to New Daily Economic News, cement prices have increased on average by 46.5% per ton compared to 2021. Rebar prices are also up 72.5% from 2021. In fact, contractors in the middle of constructing logistic assets are demanding increased fees due to rising construction costs. We expect rising construction costs may delay completion schedules to 2024 or later. Over the next two years, the pace of investment in new logistics center construction may also slow down as the cost of raw materials may be volatile until the current geopolitical instabilities start to subside. Therefore, investors need to manage the risk of rising construction costs when investing in logistics asset development projects. Reinforcement of regulations Various licensing requirements are being strengthened, including the regulations on the entry of freight vehicles into metropolitan area, a stronger Serious Disaster Punishment Act, along with stronger fire safety standards. Particularly, industrial sites closer to residential areas see more complaints from the community. Therefore, we believe it will be increasingly difficult to obtain new distribution center permits for sites close to residential areas. 12 Construction cost index Source: Colliers, Statistics Korea. 100 110 120 130 140"

In the meantime, investments in cold storage have increased along with the expansion of fresh food delivery market. The reason investors increased their investments in cold storage facilities is because they could get higher returns as cold storage facilities have higher rents than warehouses. In fact, rent for cold storage is about twice that of warehouses. However, the tenant base of cold storage facilities is more limited than general purpose warehouses. According to Korean Government data, in 2021, the number of cold storage registrations increased 23% from 68 in 2019 to 94 in 2020. We infer about 14% of total logistics assets are cold storage as 75 out of 547 newly registered warehouses are cold storage. Investors sentiment pushed capital into cold storage as a way to compensate for the high cost of acquiring land with the higher returns offered by the higher cold storage rents. However, concerns about vacancy in Incheon, Yongin, Icheon, and Hwaseong is growing as large-scale cold storage facilities come online in these areas. \u201cThe risk of vacancy may increase for cold storage projects in the development phase that have not secured tenants. We expected an increasing number facilities will change their use from cold storage to general purpose warehouses.\u201d 54 50 49 55 68"

Considering the massive growth in this sector over the last two years, analysis are asking how long can these e-commerce business continue expanding? According to data from the National Statistical Office, in May 2022, online shopping transactions amounted to KRW17.28 trillion, an increase of 10.5% from May 2021. In addition, the Korea Online Association forecasted the e-commerce market growth rate of will be 14.5% in 2022 and 13.7% in 2023. We expect the e-commerce sector to continue expanding, despite some initial signs of the growth rate slowing. Delivery volume continues to increase According to data from the Korea Integrated Logistics Association, domestic parcel delivery volumes soared from 2.7 billion units in 2019 to 3.3 billion units in 2020, and again increasing to 3.6 billion boxes in 2021. CJ Logistics, Hanjin, Lotte Global GS, Korea Post and Rosen Parcel, the top five domestic courier companies, accounted for more than 80% of the market. As 3PL companies such as CJ Korea Express, Glovis, and Pantos Logistics, which are major tenants of logistics centers, continue to grow, we expect the demand for logistics facilities to grow as well. As Coupang is reportedly planning to enter 3PL business, we believe competition from 3PL companies will continue to intensify competition for logistics center space.

The primary data source was a survey administered by GCCA staff in Spring 2018. In addition, official government reports were sources for information on the United States (U.S. Department of Agriculture) and India (India Ministry of Food Processing Industries). Summary of the Findings The total capacity of refrigerated warehouses worldwide was 616 million cubic meters in 2018, 2.67% greater than"

India was the single largest country market, at 150 million cubic meters, followed by the United States at 131 million cubic meters, and China at 105 million cubic meters. Refrigerated warehouse space was distributed unevenly across countries based on the index of market penetration developed by the Global Cold Chain Alliance (GCCA). The market development index is calculated as cold storage capacity per urban resident. The urban population is used in this benchmark because it is expected that urban centers are where the middle-class income population is concentrated. In developing country markets, the middle-class and high-income consumer segments support the demand for refrigerated and frozen foods, which ultimately drives the refrigerated warehouse service industry. Refrigerated warehouses serve various needs in the food logistics process: storage of seasonally produced foods to allow them to be available year-round, short-term storage staged in strategic locations to meet retail distribution needs, and import-export logistics facilities along global transportation routes. There are two classifications of business models: warehouses available to multiple users on a for-hire basis and those operated by a food company exclusively for the company\u2019s sole use. In this report, as in industry practice, the warehouses available for-hire on a third-party basis are referred to as \u201cpublic\u201d refrigerated warehouses, although most of them are privately owned businesses. The term \u201cprivate\u201d warehouse is reserved for those warehouses operated by a food company exclusively for that company\u2019s use. Limitations and Methodological Notes The figures in this report are the most complete data available to document the global refrigerated warehouse industries. Certain limitations should be noted due to variations in units of measure and in defining the scope of the industry. Units of measure. This report contains the potential for statistical error due to the required application of quantitative conversion factors."

        "text": "Most of the respondents to this survey collect information in cubic meters, which is the standard capacity unit adopted by the Global Cold Chain Alliance. Therefore, most of the units of measure are consistent throughout the report. However, a few nations customarily report in pallets, which presents a complication because the size of a standard pallet differs for European and American markets (see the Appendix for the applied conversion factors). Some responses were received in metric tonnage units. Tonnage units were converted to cubic meters on the basis of an assumption provided by food industry experts about the type of product stored. Scope of the industry as a limitation on the data. Warehouses that do business with a number of customers are known as public refrigerated warehouse (PRWs) and are a part of the third-party logistics (3PL) business. The Global Cold Chain Alliance is a trade association of PRWs and therefore sources large amounts of information from the PRW industry. Warehouses that were operated privately may not have 4 been thoroughly covered by the information sources affiliated with the GCCA. For example, the data collected for Mexico over the past 10 years have included only the public for-hire warehousing capacity. In 2018, the total Mexican market size was notably substantially higher because privately operated space was included in the estimate for the first time. Some national government agencies collect information on public, for-hire warehouses as well as privately operated space. Regardless of the source of information, every effort has been made to obtain a size estimate inclusive of both public space and private space, and to break out the market shares of the two types of business. The definition of the industry used by some government statistics agencies also contributes to possible inconsistency in scope of the data. For example,"

        "text": "the government of India reported on warehouse space used for vegetable and fruit products and therefore the national estimate may not include warehousing used for meat, dairy, and processed foods. In the United States, the national survey program targets those warehouses that typically store foods for more than one month. As a result, the estimate of the privately- operated warehouse space in the United States likely is understated because it does not include distribution centers used for storage over periods of less than one month. Largest Country Markets India has reported 150 million cubic meters of refrigerated warehousing in 2018, maintaining the position of the largest total capacity among the countries in the GCCA database. India had 7,645 cold storages in 2018, each averaging less than 20,000 cubic meters in size. Nearly all of the cold storage facilities were owned by private sector companies and the products stored were mainly potatoes and other vegetables. The United States, with 131 million cubic meters of refrigerated warehouse capacity, was ranked second behind India. Refrigerated facilities in the United States averaged approximately 113,000 cubic meters each. China was the third-ranked country market in 2018, at 105 million cubic meters. After several years of rapid expansion, growth in the Chinese refrigerated warehouse industry has leveled off, according to industry sources.

As expected, many of the higher-income countries had higher presence of refrigerated warehousing capacity, relative to the urban population. Per-capita market penetration in the better-served markets typically ranged from 0.3 cubic meters to 0.5 cubic meters per urban resident (Figure 2). The highest market index levels were in New Zealand (0.5), the United States (0.49), and Great Britain (0.44). Among the developing countries, Uzbekistan and Mauritius reported the highest levels of market penetration with 0.38 and 0.43 cubic meters, respectively, of refrigerated storage per urban resident. Canada and Japan were at 0.31 cubic meters per urban resident. India demonstrated continued progress in terms of cold storage capacity relative to urban population. The market development index for India rose to 0.34 in 2018, an improvement from 0.33 in 2016 and 0.30 in 2010. It should be noted that India\u2019s population is less urbanized than that of China, Brazil, and other emerging market economies.

The major change for Mexico was due to recording of privately operated space that was not disclosed in past reports. The group of countries that have low refrigerated capacity, relative to potential needs, are at less than .05 cubic meters per urban resident (Figure 4). Several of these countries have predominantly low-income households and modest presence of modern grocery retail infrastructure. 9 Figure 2: Refrigerated Warehouse Market Development Index (Capacity in Cubic Meters per Urban Resident), for Countries in the High Range of the Index, 2016 or 2018.

Food markets are dynamic and naturally vary around the world. A summary indicator 12 of the 5-year trend in food demand by country is provided in Table 4. The compound annual growth rate was calculated as: \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc45 = [( 2017 2012 ) 1 5 \u2212 1]. The figures are based on grocery retail sales value in nominal terms, in local currency (Euromonitor), which is illustrative of food markets in most respects. However, it should be noted that price changes and the composition of the food basket might drive growth in retail sales without a corresponding change in demand for storage. For example, consumers might choose different quality levels, such as expensive meat cuts, over a cheaper item, thus increasing retail sales value without a change in storage space. Or, inflation and related macroeconomic shocks can explain extremely high growth rates such as those shown for Venezuela and Argentina"

Population growth slowed over in the 2012-2016 period, as shown in the bars in Figure 5, scaled on the left axis. Consumers' incomes in India grew, as marked by the line in Figure 5 (right axis scale). However, inflation has overtaken much of this nominal increase in personal expenditures. In its forecasts published in March 2018, Euromonitor had a positive outlook for India. Overall economic growth was predicted to be 12% CAGR over 2016-2021. The retail market growth forecast is the same, at 12% annually for 2016-2021. This expectation is slightly above the annualized rate of grocery retail sales that occurred during 2012-2017 (Table 4). Inadequate roadway and warehouse infrastructure will be barriers to more rapid expansion of the freight transportation sector, including food distribution, according to Euromonitor. In 2016-2017, the Indian government invested in roadway infrastructure and built 8,231 kilometers of new highways. An additional 14 billion US dollars for road construction was allocated for 2017-2018 (Euromonitor).

The survey coverage changed to include only those facilities in the United States that store product for 4 weeks. As a result of this change, there is a discontinuity in the U.S. industry capacity figures relative to prior years. In order to provide consistency across years to the extent possible, the data for the United States presented in this report were obtained largely from GCCA sources. The GCCA estimates cover public, for-hire warehouses regardless of the duration of product storage. The GCCA does not have an estimate for privately-operated warehouses and therefore the U.S. Department of Agriculture figures were used to represent privately-operated facilities. It should be noted that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had substantially fewer privately-operated warehouses reporting under the survey program in 2017 compared with 2015. Consolidation of the U.S. industry into larger facilities continued in 2017, as it had in previous years (Table 7). The average size of a public, for-hire refrigerated warehouse in the United States was 113,487 cubic meters (approximately 5 million cubic feet). The number of U.S. refrigerated warehouses that were 5 million cubic feet or larger was nearly unchanged while a number of smaller warehouses dropped out of the national survey program.

Source: US Department of Agriculture based on survey conducted October 1, 2017. Conclusions Globally, cold storage capacity reached 616 million cubic meters in 2018, an increase of 2.7% since 2016. The three largest country markets\u2014India, the United States, and China\u2014 accounted for 60% of the global total of refrigerated space. Total refrigerated warehouse capacity was compared with urban population to obtain a market development index that sheds light on the extent of unmet needs in a particular country. On average, there are approximately 0.2 cubic meters of refrigerated warehousing space per urban resident globally. Variation in the market development index across countries was significant, as a result of differences in consumers\u2019 buying power in the countries as well as differences in food production and trading patterns. Based on the findings for 2018, Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, and China had the largest unmet need for refrigerated warehouse space. Sizes of refrigerated warehouses ranged from over 100,000 cubic meters in developed economies to 15,000- 25,000 per facility in emerging market and lower-income economies. There may be corresponding differences in occupancy or inventory turnover rates that result in small facilities potentially generating services and income comparable to larger facilities. A number of smaller warehouses located across food production areas might also be used to serve farmers and food security needs in food production areas where transportation links are limited. 25 References ABIAF (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira da Ind\u00fastria de"

The conversion from weight-based units (metric tons) to volume units (cubic meters) depends on the product in storage, and we lack specific information on products for many countries. As a result, approximations of capacity in volume were made for certain countries. The conversions that were used in this report are: 1 Pallet = 6.65 cubic meters, for countries in the Americas. European pallets are converted at 1 Pallet = 1.944 cubic meters. 1 Metric ton = 4.3 cubic meters 1 Cubic meter = 35.31 cubic feet"

Given emerging challenges and threats to its growth trajectory\u2014through increasing international protectionism, a slowing global economy, and climate change\u2014ensuring Vietnam\u2019s competitiveness will require implementation of policies and investments that position the country to best adapt to the changing global environment.

This report features a comprehensive overview of connectivity issues in Vietnam and uses a set of new analytical tools and analyses to inform policy makers and other key stakeholders on policy options and investment strategies to support Vietnam\u2019s integration with global and domestic markets, strengthen, and promote spatial inclusion, along with its resilience. In conclusion, the report presents a set of nine focused recommendations organized in four mutually reinforcing areas of connectivity related to (a) Integration with Global Markets, (b) Integration across Domestic Markets, (c) Spatial Inclusion, and (d) Building Resilience. I am grateful for the close collaboration between the World Bank and Ministry of Planning and Investment, through the Vietnam Institute for Development Strategy led by Mr. Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n V\u1ecbnh, Vice President, and also for the financial support provided by the Government of Australia through the Second Australia\u2013World Bank Group Strategic Partnership in Vietnam. The report is published at a critical time when the Government of Vietnam is developing its new development strategy to guide the next 10 years, through its Socio-Economic Development Strategy for 2021\u20132030.

Vietnam\u2019s major trade partners located in East Asia, North America, and Europe are reached mostly by sea or air. Trade with bordering neighbors is limited and thus trade across border-crossing points is minimal except for northern borders with China, which has seen growth in recent years. The country\u2019s trade flows are concentrated at twelve of its 48 border gates\u2014two airports, five seaports and five border crossing points\u2014which collectively handled 86 percent of total trade value in 2016.1 As the trade grows, congestion at and near these international gateways and border-crossing points has also increased. In addition to the current major trade partners, various regional trade relations and connectivity initiatives are relevant to Vietnam, including with Southeast Asian neighbors, and South Asia\u2014particularly India\u2014over land, given the rapidly growing trade relationships. In the meantime, Vietnam\u2019s transport network has undergone a significant expansion over the past decades. The most remarkable development in network expansion has occurred in the road sector. As of 2016 the total length of the road network, excluding village roads, reached over 300,000 km, including about 1,000 km of expressways\u2014a fully access-controlled toll road system. Vietnam is endowed with an extensive network of natural waterways, including nearly 16,000 km of managed navigable routes carrying significant traffic around the Red River Delta and Mekong Delta areas. However, only about 2,600 km of the waterways can reliably handle barges greater than 300 deadweight tons, with rudimentary terminal infrastructure at most of its numerous river ports. Vietnam\u2019s century-old railway system is mostly single-tracked and non-electrified, which has remained unchanged over the past decades with very limited capital investments. Vietnam\u2019s extensive seaport system includes 45 ports and nearly 200 terminals."

Vietnam\u2019s aviation sector has seen rapid growth in the recent years, with its air freight growing at an average rate of 10.8 percent per year from 2009 to 2017. Despite the growing importance of air freight transportation, which accounts for about 25 percent of Vietnam\u2019s export and import value, infrastructure is still limited. Only four of 22 airports in Vietnam have separate cargo terminals, and two have onsite logistics centers. Despite this remarkable success, Vietnam still faces many connectivity challenges. The quality and extent of transport infrastructure is uneven across the country; some key trade corridors and international gateways are growing increasingly congested while others remain underutilized or underdeveloped, as seen with logistics services, especially the segment serving the domestic markets. Natural disasters and other hazards pose increasing threats to the country\u2019s infrastructure and livelihood. With these complex challenges in the backdrop, in this report we examine the link between connectivity and three critical development goals of Vietnam\u2014integration, inclusion and resilience. Integrating with Global Markets Vietnam\u2019s trade grew alongside its deepening global integration and participation into global value chains. The revolution in information and communication technologies and falling transportation and communications costs drove offshoring and unbundling of production from the developed to the developing world and gave rise to global value chains.

For this report, we explored how Vietnam\u2019s integration with global markets can be further supported through a connectivity strategy, and in doing so, carried out an extensive spatial analysis to address the following questions: \u2022 Which specific sectors or value chains require the most attention? \u2022 Are some value chains more dependent on transport and logistics connectivity than others? \u2022 Which corridors will prove critical as Vietnam aspires to improve its trade competitiveness? Our analysis has resulted in identification of \u201cvalue chain critical\u201d transport corridors for nine value chains, which combined account for over 70 percent of Vietnam\u2019s export.2 Geographically, these key corridors are located (a) around the largest economic centers\u2014Hanoi and HCMC\u2014connecting nearby provinces that participate in the value chains, (b) between Mekong delta region and HCMC, (c) between Hanoi and northern Chinese borders, (d) along the north-south coastal line, and (e) between central highlands and the south. Ensuring quality infrastructure and necessary logistics services along these corridors would help lower the trade and transport costs associated with these value chains, which are crucial for Vietnam\u2019s export competitiveness. Vietnam\u2019s international trade is predominantly handled at a handful of key airports, seaports, and border crossing points. With the rapid increase in air cargos, many stakeholders are increasingly concerned with the physical and operational capacities at key airports. Two historically dominant seaports in Ho Chi Minh City and Haiphong operate near capacity, with connecting roads plagued 3 Executive Summarywith burgeoning congestion. At the same time, the relatively new deep-sea ports in Vung Tau seaport complex and Lach Huyen present opportunities to further consolidate cargo, attract large intercontinental vessels, and hence lower transport costs and transit time. Investments in hinterland connectivity are critical for success of these ports."

Economic clusters in Vietnam, in the form of industrial parks or economic zones, have been developed around main corridors, near primary international gateways, or around major urban areas. Their success, measured in terms of investments attracted and employment generated, is affected by connectivity, along with other factors. As Vietnam develops a major high-capacity, high- speed transport network\u2014such as the North\u2013South Expressway\u2014thereby shortening economic distances across the country, new transport nodes are created as potential candidates for future economic clusters. Future investments in major connective infrastructure should therefore be closely coordinated with land-use plan to encourage development of the land surrounding high- value transport nodes for high productivity activities. \u201cEconomic densities\u201d should be created along these new corridors. Integrating Domestic Markets The Vietnamese population is growing richer and more urban. The \u201cconsumer class,\u201d which consumes US$5.50 or more per person per day, is rapidly expanding from about 49 percent in 2010 to over 70 percent in 2016. Approximately 89 percent of urban dwellers belong to the consumer class, compared to around 66 percent of the rural population. This emerging group consumes more, and more diverse, goods and services than their poorer counterparts. These changes in consumption patterns, caused by a sharp rise of incomes, could lead to changes in what is moved where, how, and at what costs. Vietnam faces complex food problems related to the supply, distribution, and quality assurance for fresh perishable foods. Despite the rapid surge in consumer demand for fresh foods, especially in urban areas, the supply and distribution channels have undergone remarkably little change: consumers"

Increasing demand for fresh foods, combined with persistent traditional methods of moving and distributing foods, have resulted in significant food losses, unsafe foods, negative environmental impacts, and public health threats. In order to develop efficient, sustainable, and safe food chains, Vietnamese cities need to overhaul their market infrastructure and improve the governance around food chains through regulatory coordination. Generating sufficient demand for safe and traceable food, through raising awareness among consumers and building trust in the system is also important, as greater demand would mean a higher willingness-to-pay for safer food, which would then create greater demand for sophisticated transportation and logistics services for food, such as cold chain transportation and storages. 4 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityRelated to the above specific concerns around food chains, Vietnam\u2019s logistics service providers, especially those serving domestic markets, are still small in scale and have much room to embrace technologies to improve their efficiency. The trucking sector, which is among the most critical players in the logistics sector, is highly fragmented with about half of the companies generating annual revenues of around US$0.5 million. In a national survey, truck operators reported that about 60 to 70 percent of the time, their trucks return empty. Underdeveloped non-asset-based brokerage and intermediary services, along with limited automation and use of technology further constrain the ability of the trucking sector to consolidate cargo efficiently. Together, the state of logistics services and the emerging trends of e-commerce signify new connectivity needs.

Along with all its potential benefits, e-commerce has led to growing needs for new types of logistics services, involving door- to-door connectivity, last-mile delivery, and urban storages that can meet the demand yet provide proximity. All of these bring additional challenges in fast-growing, congested cities in Vietnam, which are faced with competing urban mobility needs, namely between daily commutes and urban freight transport. Considering the various stakeholders with competing needs, solving urban logistics in Vietnam\u2019s already built-up and congested large cities is complicated and would require creative and complex solutions involving urban commuters, cargo owners, businesses in urban areas, and logistics service providers.

Based on the the GSO-WB poverty line, the incidence of poverty in 2016 ranged from approximately 1 percent in the Southeast region to 24 percent in the Central Highlands region and 28 percent in the Northern Mountainous region. Median household incomes are lower and poverty is more concentrated in the remote and low-density population parts of Vietnam offering limited productive opportunities. Limited access to off-farm opportunities accounts for much of the income differences across regions, mirroring the spatial variation in the economic structure within the country. Average incomes are significantly lower in high mountain communes\u2014especially in the non-farm wages, households\u2019 businesses, and remittances categories.

Improved market access also mitigates the disadvantage of low population density and is associated with higher wage-participation for 5 Executive Summarywives than their husbands, highlighting the potential for improved market access to reduce gender disparities in wage-job participation. The analysis shows the improvements in transport infrastructure increased market access, which in turn increases wages and attracts more population. During the last decade, the travel time and transport costs from most localities of Vietnam to major urban areas and international gateways has reduced significantly, thanks to the expansion of the transport network and improvement of road conditions. Over the period from 2009 to 2017, improvements in connectivity have raised national welfare and real incomes for all communes. For instance, welfare benefits result from increases in domestic trade within the country due to reduction in travel time. Connectivity improvements from 2009 to 2017 have slowed down the concentration rate of workers in the main two urban poles, benefiting more distant areas in the Northwest and along the coastline. We also tested the potential impacts of future connectivity improvements on national real income and spatial inequality, under two scenarios: the first focuses on upgrading or rehabilitating national highways mostly in remote areas and near border-crossing points, while the second completes the planned North\u2013South Expressway.

Building Resilience Vietnam\u2019s extensive transport network is exposed to various hazards, including landslide, fluvial (river) flooding, typhoon, and flash flooding, all of which are increasing in intensity and frequency due to climate change. With 60 percent of its land area and 71 percent of its population exposed to risk, Vietnam ranks high as a natural disaster hotspot of two or more multihazard events, which could result in annual average asset losses amounting to 1.5 percent of GDP and loss in consumption amounting to 2 percent of GDP. With events of extreme intensity expected to become more frequent due to climate change, Vietnam\u2019s major sea, air, and river ports are similarly exposed to natural hazards and thus to the risks of major flow disruption. The potential economic impacts of disruptions related to natural hazards could be significant, accounting for increases in transport costs of rerouting and reduction in production due to input\u2013output linkages of goods moved on the affected transport link. Some transport links, which carry significant traffic with few rerouting options, are estimated to incur substantial economic losses if disrupted by an extreme event\u2014as high as US$20 million\u2014a value many times greater than the cost of rebuilding the asset. Our analysis suggests that upfront investments to upgrade and rehabilitate existing assets, focusing those that are economically critical, are well justified.

We found that multimodal transport could be a resilient strategy in that less reliance on one mode would reduce the expected economic losses. Building truly multimodal connectivity, however, is a challenging task that would require improvement in infrastructure, regulatory framework, market incentives, and development of logistics services. Currently, the key bottlenecks preventing Vietnam from achieving efficient multimodal connectivity include (a) the lack of containerization on inland waterway transport, (b) underdeveloped river ports with poor land connectivity and rudimentary cargo handling equipment, and (c) underutilized potential of domestic coastal shipping constrained both by infrastructure and market structures. Overcoming these roadblocks to achieving a more resilient transport system in Vietnam would require concerted efforts across multiple stakeholders. For better connectivity for Vietnam, we propose actions around nine key recom- mendations: 1. Re-orient transport and spatial planning to support critical value chains. Transport planning and investment strategies need be informed by value chain criticality, so that connectivity can best serve Vietnam\u2019s further integration with the global markets. At present, trade information, especially on value chains, is rarely used in policy formulation or infrastructure investment decisions. In order to mainstream such practices, the entire eco-system of trade and transport links needs to be created, including systematic collection of relevant trade and transport data, a system where such data are consolidated and analyzed, and procedures by which the analytical outputs have tangible influence over the planning and investment decision processes. The ongoing efforts by the Ministry of Transport (MoT) to establish the Vietnam Logistics Statistical System need to be completed and further built upon. 2.

As Vietnam\u2019s trade grows, capacities at its largest international gateways grow increasingly constrained, while several gateways face serious inland connectivity issues. To address these challenges, Vietnam needs to further develop new gateways with greater capacity and efficiency (in the case of the planned Long Thanh airport and Lach Huyen seaport), while improving coordination across the central and provincial governments in ensuring hinterland connectivity of main gateways. Moreover, we recommend considering these critical gateways as a network with complementary roles and discouraging wasteful competition among various localities. Consolidation at gateways with the structure and capabilities to handle intercontinental vessels, supported by good domestic shipping and land connectivity, is beneficial for importers, exporters, and shippers alike, as such an arrangement can significantly lower transit time and reduce trade costs with some of Vietnam\u2019s major trade partners. 3. Create \u201ceconomic densities\u201d along new corridors. Vietnam\u2019s newly developing high- capacity high-speed connective infrastructure provides unique opportunity to reduce \u201ceconomic distances\u201d while creating \u201ceconomic densities.\u201d Both outcomes can be achieved by allowing targeted 7 Executive Summarydevelopment around \u201chigh value\u201d transport nodes created around new infrastructure, such as expressways.

While LSPs serving the foreign direct investment (FDI) sector expand and become more sophisticated, domestic trade is still primarily served by rudimentary services. With a growing number of urban consumers increasingly demanding competitive prices along with higher standards of services, such as safety, punctuality, freshness, and traceability of traded goods, this presents an opportune moment for growth of LSPs serving the domestic markets. The government can support this private-sector-driven development by creating an enabling regulatory environment, enforcing standards, and \u201cnudging\u201d the consumers to support a competitive market, accomplished through raising awareness around safe food chain, employing policies to support upscaling the LSP and bringing in new technologies, and encouraging creation of brokerage and intermediary services, including third-party or fourth-party logistics. 5. Overhaul market infrastructure and logistics in cities. Vietnamese cities should upgrade, and in some cases relocate, their market infrastructure, which is predominantly outdated and in traditional forms (for example, wet markets). Currently, with few exceptions, matters of needs, risk and performance of food system and other urban consumption activities are not mainstreamed into urban land-use planning, logistics, environmental management or overall municipal governance. And, in most agricultural strategies and plans, cities are identified as end points for consumption, but not as active, responsible players in governance of supply chains including for food. Moreover, consideration for urban logistics is often omitted in the current practices of transport planning in major urban areas. Logistics facilities of various hierarchy, such as inland container depots, cargo handling facilities at critical interurban connection points (railway stations, domestic airports, and ports, for instance), urban distribution centers, and small warehousing in urban areas, should be brought into the domain of the formal transport planning process, to"

Connect low-density communities to markets. Vietnam should continue providing connectivity for remote and low-density areas of the country,3 to reduce economic distance and improve market access for all localities, by connecting them to main economic corridors rather than nearby, similarly low-density adjacent localities. Our empirical analysis provides evidence that connectivity brings more employment opportunities, greater wages, better opportunities to participate in domestic and international trade, and thus improved welfare. We also found that connectivity can offset the negative impacts of low density on employment potential and wages, and thus, providing connectivity proves even more critical for low-density communes in the country. 8 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared Prosperity7. Complement connectivity with social and economic support. Vietnam should employ complementary policies such as lowering barriers to labor mobility and providing universal access to quality education and health, in parallel with the investments and policies for connectivity improvement. Our analysis shows that with no constraints to labor mobility, improved connectivity will reduce spatial inequality. By facilitating free movement of people to locations that offer opportunities for better jobs and higher wages\u2014thanks in part to better connectivity\u2014the economy as a whole can maximize the benefits of improved connectivity. At the household level, while good market access strongly correlates with positive economic outcomes (accounting for 30 to 34 percent of the gaps in off-farm employment across different geographical locations and ethnicities), the remaining gaps could be explained by other factors, such as education attainment and agriculture related endowments and resources. Therefore, to be sufficient for inclusive welfare increase for all populations in Vietnam, improved connectivity should be accompanied by complementary policies. 8.

Located along coastal lines, mountainous areas, or flood-prone terrains, Vietnam\u2019s critical transport links are highly vulnerable to various climatic events, therefore justifying significant upfront investments to strengthen their resilience and reduce their vulnerability\u2014 even more so under climate-change scenarios. Investments in resilient and reliable connectivity should therefore mainstreamed through the rigorous collection and analysis of multisector data on infrastructure, meteorology, hydrology, and geology.

Promote multimodal transport as a resilient strategy. Vietnam\u2019s economic activities rely heavily on its increasingly congested road network, part of which is vulnerable to natural disasters. At the same time, Vietnam\u2019s natural endowment such as an inland waterway network and long coastal lines, is underutilized and not fully explored. Multimodal transport therefore makes a good connectivity strategy, both in terms of transport costs and resilience of connectivity. Our geospatial analysis supports this argument: Even a modest modal shift from road to waterborne transport\u2014 economically beneficial given the lower transport costs of the latter\u2014would reduce risk exposure and improve resilience of the overall transport network.

Vietnam\u2019s trade activities are concentrated at twelve of its 48 border gates, including two airports, five seaports and five border crossing points, which collectively handled 91 percent of total trade value in 2016 (see figure 1.2 and figure 1.3). Vietnam\u2019s major trade partners are reached mostly by sea or air. Trade activity with bordering neighbors is limited; trade across border-crossing points is minimal except for the northern borders with China, which has seen growth in recent years. As seen in figure 1.2 and figure 1.3, seaports and airports near the major economic centers in the north and south play important and increasing roles. As the trade grows, congestion at and near these international gateways and border-crossing points also increases. For instance, the road network around Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) port complex, especially Cat Lai port, is among the most congested part of the road network around HCMC.(A) Top 10 export destinations (B) T op 10 import origins 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009"

Comparing trade values, volumes, and change from 2011 to 2016, we see the role of Vietnam\u2019s two major airports expanding drastically, handling high-value, time-sensitive cargo. In fact, these airports serve as key gateways for major foreign direct investments (FDIs) around Hanoi and HCMC, which are part of global value chains (GVC) and rely on import of high-value inputs for assembly and export of final products. In terms of volume, the key seaports also play major roles. In addition to the two busiest ports in HCMC and Haiphong, the relatively new Cai Mep Thi Vai (CMTV) port in Vung Tau, which can handle much larger vessels than any other ports in Vietnam, plays an increasingly critical role. 14 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared Prosperity(A) Trade values (B) Trade volumes 020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000140,000160,000 Export 2016 Export 2011 Import 2016 Import 2011US$, millionsLand: Lao Cai Land: Mong Cai, Quang Ninh Land: Quang Binh, Quang Tri Land: Tay Ninh Seaport: Cai Lan, Quang Ninh Land: Huu Nghi, Lang Son Seaport: Tien Sa, Da Nang Seaport: Vung Tau Complex Airport: Tan Son Nhat, HCMC Seaport: Hai Phong Complex Airport: Noi Bai, Hanoi Seaport: HCMC Complex 020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000140,000 Export 2016 Export 2011 Import 2016 Import 2011Thousand tonsAirport: Noi Bai, Hanoi Airport: Tan Son Nhat, HCMC Seaport: Tien Sa, Da Nang Seaport: Hai Phong Complex Seaport: Vung Tau Complex Seaport: Cai Lan, Quang Ninh Seaport: HCMC ComplexFIGURE 1.3.

The regional connectivity agenda can be considered at different scales, to reflect the diversity of needs and the nuances of different supply chains. These scales include connectivity within the immediate Southeast Asia neighborhood, and the evolving and expanding links with China as well as to South Asia. Deepening intra-ASEAN connectivity is among the ongoing priority trade initiatives for Vietnam. Vietnam has a long history of cooperation on connectivity within the sub-region, through its participation in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) initiative, launched in 1992 by Vietnam and five other riparian states of the Mekong River (Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Thailand). The program, still under implementation, focuses on cross-border infrastructure development in a few priority economic corridors with the goal of enhancing economic cooperation among the participating economies. While some of these corridors are lightly traveled, the GMS region\u2019s basic core infrastructure could support further trade integration. 15 Chapter 1: Vietnam \u2013 The State of ConnectivityAnother, potentially more consequential regional connectivity initiative involving Vietnam is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Master Plan for Connectivity (MPAC 2025), which includes all ten economies in the ASEAN. Trade with other ASEAN economies accounts for 25 percent of Vietnam\u2019s trade, just higher than the 23 percent average for all ASEAN economies (ASEAN Secretariat 2018). Growth in ASEAN has been driven by regional value chains, comprised of trade in tasks across the region. Improvements in connectivity have underpinned and shaped the regional integration agenda. However, important gaps in connectivity remain. For instance, at the ASEAN level, estimates place the requirements for infrastructure improvements at more than US$110 billion a year, at"

MPAC 2025 is intended to guide the development of infrastructure for further integration within ASEAN. The short-term priorities for Vietnam and its ASEAN neighbors focus on completing the core regional network, such as highway corridors between Vietnam and Cambodia or Lao PDR. The medium-term agenda includes establishing new highway or railway connections between these countries, along the corridors with increasing trade volume. For instance, in recent years, Vietnam\u2019s National Highway 22 between Ho Chi Minh City and the Moc Bai border gate to Cambodia has seen traffic growth at more than 7 percent per year (World Bank 2019a). Improvement of these corridors, and the resulting time savings will become increasingly important across the ASEAN region as the region upgrades to predominantly higher value goods. Therefore, participating countries must approach the core regional network development, consisting of these critical trade corridors, in a coordinated manner. Ultimately, the benefits of connectivity will be maximized when a network is appropriately interconnected, especially by completing links between the most important nodes. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a large-scale initiative that focuses on enhancing global connectivity, may present opportunity for Vietnam to leverage its potential. Vietnam is one of more than seventy countries participating in the BRI. Vietnam is part of the China Indochina Peninsula Economic Corridor (CICPEC) intended to enhance connectivity between the following key cities: Nanning (China), Hanoi, Vientiane (Lao PDR), Ho Chi Minh City, Phnom Penh (Cambodia), Bangkok (Thailand), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), and Singapore. Recent estimates by the World Bank (World Bank 2019b) suggest that trade costs for East Asia economies would fall from implementing BRI-associated projects and trade facilitation measures.

This new railway connection will interconnect with the Thailand system, and could potentially be interlinked via a Vietnam\u2013Cambodia railway link and to a proposed high-speed railway in Vietnam between Hanoi and HCMC. While the feasibility of such a significant undertaking should be carefully assessed, a network-level assessment suggests that completing these core BRI networks could enhance the centrality and importance of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in the network of cities in Southeast Asia (Derudder, Liu, and Kunaka 2018). An increase in centrality will make the center more attractive for investment and as traffic intermediation nodes in the region. 16 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityWhile the infrastructure improvements are ongoing, logistics operations have been initiated along segments of the main corridors, such as the train container services between China and Vietnam. The introduction of block-train container services between China and Vietnam have helped to reduce goods shipping costs between the two countries and reduced some past constraints encountered with individual wagonload traffic (Bullock, Liu, and Tan 2019). Sending freight across borders in individual wagonloads often meant long delays waiting for connections, and especially for other processes such as transshipment or customs inspections. Block container services have proven much cheaper, especially from same origin to same destination. This outcome points to the importance of consolidating regional traffic at a handful of nodes and along a few cross-border routes. The effects of border procedures and attendant delays are most visible with road transport, which incur significant amounts of time and costs. Table 1.1 shows a cost comparison of shipping goods in a container by road and rail, and over similar distances between China and Vietnam.1 The costs of shipping by road"

Trade between the ASEAN region and South Asia has been growing strongly in recent years and has the potential to continue growing (table 1.2). In South Asia, India is the most important trade partner.

In addition, Vietnam also signed several trade agreements that opened access to new market access. More recently, the country has pursued deeper integration with ASEAN partners, participating in larger agreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and agreements with the European Union. However, the ability to realize the full potential of the various agreements is hampered by a proliferation of complicated and burdensome non-tariff measures (NTMs) constraining trade.2 Thus, streamlining of NTMs is important for facilitating preferential market access between Vietnam and some new markets, especially South Asia. Vietnam\u2019s Transport Network Within the mainland Vietnam, the transport network has undergone significant expansion over the past decades, improving the connectivity of all localities in the country to these international gateways. Most remarkable development in network expansion occurred in the road sector. The total length of the road network, excluding village roads, more than tripled since 1992, reaching over 300,000 km as of 2016 (figure 1.4). As a result, the number of commune centers without access to all weather roads decreased from more than 600 in 1997 to 65 in 2016.TABLE 1.2.

In addition to the public network, industrial rail systems, with a total length of 120 km, primarily serve mineral and industrial enterprises undertaking their own operations. The Vietnam railway system currently carries about 10.5 million passengers (or 4 billion passenger-km) and 5.5 million freight tons (or 3.9 billion ton-km) annually. With volumes remaining mostly constant for the last several years, railway accounts for under 5 percent of the country\u2019s total movement of goods and people.

Maritime cargo throughput has continued to increase, as has the share of domestic throughput via coastal or short-sea shipping (see figure 1.6). As illustrated in figure 1.3 above, the two seaport complexes in the north (Haiphong) and in the south (HCMC) serve as the primary international gateways and handle much of the country\u2019s trade volume.

Vietnam\u2019s first deep-sea port, the Vung Tau seaport complex, lies approximately 50 km south from the existing HCMC port complex, has been developed to handle up to 180,000 DWT vessels. However, the container volume handled in this port complex is far below its capacity due to the inadequate hinterland connectivity by land and IWT. In the northern part of the country, the first container terminal at the Lach Huyen deep- sea port in Haiphong, further east from the existing Haiphong Complex, started operating in 2018. Several other deep-sea ports have opened as well, including Tien Sa in Danang and Cai Lan in Quang Ninh province.

While recognizing successes and achievements, however, we argue the current state of connectivity presents many challenges, both present and future. Behind the rapid expansion of the physical capacity of transport infrastructure is the issue of mismatch between connectivity demand and supply. The overall system heavily relies on road transport, which carries three-quarters of total cargo volumes, with very few multimodal trips due to weak intermodal links. Routes, therefore, are not optimized.

Vietnam\u2019s heavy exposure to various types of natural hazard\u2014among them typhoons, flooding, and landslides\u2014means potential serious vulnerability of the built infrastructures and overwhelming needs to ensure resilience. From this global benchmarking, Vietnam\u2019s quality of trade and transport-related infrastructure apparently has not been able to keep pace with its trade growth and development. The trade competitiveness potential in Vietnam is constrained by the lack of policy orientation toward promoting trade-oriented connectivity. The external and domestic changes in Vietnam, including evolving international trade relationships, the country\u2019s comparative advantages in global economy, and its rapidly changing patterns of domestic consumption, will have implications on future connectivity needs. Because trade has grown in Vietnam much faster than in other countries, at the current GDP and level of openness, the country might be vulnerable to volatile global trends, especially when considering the recent rise in protectionism and trade tension. This means that in addition to its current strong GVC participation, Vietnam might need to further diversify its trade partners and expand its domestic consumption base. Connectivity as a lever to achieve integration, inclusion, and resilience? Against the backdrop described above, this report aims to examine the link between connectivity and the critical development goals of Vietnam: integration, inclusion, and resilience, which are discussed as follows and depicted in figure 1.9: ConnectivityIntegration Inclusion ResilienceFIGURE 1.9.

        "text": "integration with the global markets represents a critical factor in Vietnam\u2019s continued growth. The recent World Bank report, Vietnam at a Crossroads: Engaging in the Next Generation of Global Value Chains (Hollweg, Smith, and Taglioni 2017), notes that Vietnam\u2019s connections to international trade networks are good, but less strong than with its neighboring countries, which limits regional competitiveness. The report further notes that poor efficiency of customs clearance, weak infrastructure quality, and the quality and competence of service providers limits logistics and trade facilitation. Vietnam has thus room to develop in regional value chain trade, greater network centrality, participation relative to per capita income, and strengthened forward and backward links. The changing geopolitical relationships among Vietnam\u2019s key trade partners and global trade patterns, and these external conditions could have significant impacts on Vietnam\u2019s growth potential, its roles in future value chains, and jobs (Cunningham and Pimhidzai 2018). Vietnam\u2019s trade and transport connectivity could affect how Vietnam responds to, and influences, the external conditions. The second dimension of integration is that of domestic markets, which consists of rural and urban links and connectivity around and within growing urban areas. Vietnam\u2019s urbanization is still very much in progress, both in terms of population and physical footprint of its growing cities. Its expanding middle-class population predominantly resides in urban areas, with their rising incomes and rapidly changing consumption patterns and habits. This richer and more urban population is more reliant on traded consumption than on self-produced consumption. Thus, better domestic connectivity would be needed to serve this growing consumer base, including connectivity for food supply logistics, urban mobility, and the emergent e-commerce sector. Faced with uncertainties and risks around international trade, the \u201cconsumer class\u201d and domestic markets in Vietnam provide a new opportunity for its growth, calling for attention to the domestic connectivity"

Despite the commendable efforts made by the government to date, spatial disparity across the country remains vast and most of the remaining poverty is concentrated in remote areas and among ethnic minorities. This changing nature of poverty reduction is combined with physical remoteness and low access to infrastructure, services, and market opportunities. There still are pockets of very remote areas with limited economic opportunities other than subsistence farming. In order to solve this \u201clast-mile\u201d problem of the inclusion agenda, it is important to understand the impacts of the past improvement in connectivity on the economic outcomes of individuals and households depending on their locations. By analyzing how connectivity can affect economic outcomes, the direction for future interventions can be set out. As a growing middle-income country with a large stock of existing infrastructure assets, fostering resilience is a crucial foundation for Vietnam to sustain its development and well- being of the society and individuals. Vietnam has suffered significant economic losses during recent years in the form of damages to infrastructure and livelihood, and furthermore, is among the most vulnerable countries to worsening natural disasters due to climate change. Connectivity in Vietnam therefore needs to be resilient against future risks, in order to support the above two goals\u2014 25 Chapter 1: Vietnam \u2013 The State of Connectivitymarket integration and inclusive growth. Currently, considering the pace at which infrastructure is built both at national and local levels, the underlying system of assessing risks and managing the built assets is under-developed.

Based on such analysis, the economic costs of future natural hazards and other forms of disruptions should be estimated, which will help"

Report Outline In addressing the above critical development goals, we organized the remainder of the report into five distinct but inter-related chapters, each analyzing central aspects in the case for \u201cConnecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared Prosperity.\u201d Chapter 2: Integrating with Global Markets\u2014Analyzes the connectivity in the context of Vietnam\u2019s trade competitiveness and participation in global value chains. The chapter covers value chain-critical transport corridors, performance and efficiency of international gateways, and the relationship between economic clusters and corridor development. Chapter 3: Integrating Domestic Markets\u2014Analyzes connectivity for domestic consumers in the context of the emergence of urban middle-class consumers, which has given rise to demand for e-commerce and perishable foods in cities. The chapter also discusses the connectivity implications of recent trends as well as the challenges of urban logistics. Chapter 4: Delivering on \u201cLast-Mile\u201d\u2014Focuses on Inclusion, and the role of connectivity in achieving inclusiveness of economic growth in Vietnam. The chapter provides a conceptual link between connectivity and economic outcomes, measurement of connectivity in terms of market access, empirical relationships between market access on economic outcomes, and the welfare effects of transport network development. Chapter 5: Building Resilience\u2014Provides an in-depth analysis on the vulnerability of transport connectivity and how Vietnam can improve resilience through network analysis and prioritization techniques. Chapter 6: Recommendations\u2014Summarizes key recommendations based on the analyses of the previous chapters outlined above and outlines key connectivity-related policy priorities for implementation. 26 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityNOTES 1.

Trade\u2014especially export\u2014competitiveness is largely determined by trade costs as well as costs for goods and services. Trade costs comprise tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and transport and logistics costs (TLC). As tariffs on international trade have been sharply reduced and manufacturing costs have increased, Vietnam\u2019s export competitiveness increasingly depends on factors such as quality, productivity, efficient supply chains, and lower transport and logistics costs. This chapter examines Vietnam\u2019s participation in GVCs, its spatial relationship between trade and transport, and the way in which trade and transport infrastructure can be improved to support Vietnam\u2019s trade competitiveness. 29 Chapter 2: Integrating with Global MarketsVietnam and the Global Value Chain1 Global empirical evidence shows that trade promotes growth. Through increased competition, trade reallocates resources toward more productive sectors and firms and boosts real incomes by lowering prices for consumers and firms. And by supporting growth, trade openness can also be an important driver of poverty reduction. During the period between 1960 and 1990, eight high- performing Asian economies in terms of trade\u2014Japan; Republic of Korea; Taiwan, China; Hong Kong SAR, China; Singapore; Malaysia; Indonesia; and Thailand\u2014had an average growth rate of 5.5 percent per year, higher and more sustainable than any other groups of countries in the world (Birdsall and others 1993). Vietnam is no exception. The export-led growth strategy and global integration adopted in Vietnam have been key factors, among other things, for Vietnam\u2019s remarkable achievement over the last more than two-and-half decades in generating economic growth and poverty reduction. During the period from 1992 to 2017, Vietnam developed into one of the world\u2019s most open trading countries, with an export-to-GDP ratio of more than 100 percent in 2017.

Since 1995, Vietnam has carved out a role for itself within GVCs, showing higher integration as a buyer and a seller in GVCs. An improved business environment for attracting qualified foreign direct investments (FDI) has promoted Vietnam\u2019s participation in a number of GVCs. Between 1995 and 2011, Vietnam grew its domestic value added\u2014embodied in its gross export\u2014by 16.6 percent annually, just below what had been achieved by China. By specializing in assembly functions on behalf of primarily foreign firms, Vietnam\u2019s export-oriented development strategy has created jobs, propelled economic growth, and reduced poverty. As a result of GVC participation, Vietnam\u2019s export structure has changed dramatically, both in terms of technology embodied in export and product-based export. Figure 2.2 shows a significant structural change in technology embodied in export during the period between 1997 and 2017. The demonstration is built on UNComtrade\u2019s international classification of export technology levels, including low tech, medium tech, high tech, primary, and resource-based. The export share of low- and medium-technology, resource-based products did not change significantly during this period. However, the proportion of primary products has declined markedly, mainly due to a decline in crude oil export and export control policy to limit minerals and raw material export. At the same time, the share of high-technology products export increased sharply, a trend closely associated with huge investment projects of some leading multinationals\u2014including Samsung Group and Intel Corporation\u2014which selected Vietnam as a production base for mobile phone and tablet products for export worldwide.

In devising a connectivity strategy to continue supporting such trends, one might want to ask: \u2022 Which specific sectors or value chains require the most attention? \u2022 Are some value chains more dependent on transport and logistics connectivity than others? \u2022 Which corridors will become critical as Vietnam aspires to improve its trade competitiveness?

Provinces Participating in Aquaculture Value Chain Linkages The final step is to link the value chains with the transport network, to identify parts of the \u201cvalue-chain critical\u201d network. A value chain\u2019s connective propensity is analyzed based on locational distribution of its segments and linkages, as well as its interaction with the transport network. Traffic is assumed to flow on the lowest cost paths between the key locations along each segment of a value chain, from the inputs, production and processing, and end consumers, which in the case of an export-dominant sector are located at key international gateways. Figure 2.7 presents the results of transport mapping for aquaculture. By repeating the same analysis for all nine value chains, which combined account for more than 70 percent of total export, the export value-chain critical transport corridors are identified, as shown in figure 2.8. The thickness of a transport link represents the number of value chain linkages relying on it and highlights the parts of the network crucial to support not just movement of final export products, but also the backward input linkages connecting them.

Trade costs are highly dependent on the connectivity between border gates and the wider transport network, the efficiency of cargo handling procedures at borders as well as the interrelations and connectivity between border gates. Achieving efficiency at border gates is challenging due to the evolving nature of trade flow and volumes and involvement of multiple stakeholders in the eventual outcomes.

Nevertheless, the recent trends and feedback from various industry stakeholders can point us to key challenges and directions for future development. While Vietnam operates 48 border gates in 31 provinces, trade flows are concentrated in only a handful of border gates. As briefly discussed in chapter 1, the top 12 border gates, two airports, five seaports and five land border-crossing points handled more than 91 percent of total trade in value in 2016 (see figure 1.2 and figure 1.3). Furthermore, the six most significant gateways, consisting of HCMC seaport complex, Haiphong seaport complex, Vung Tau seaport complex, Lang Son (land port on the Chinese border), Noi Bai airport (Hanoi), and Tan Son Nhat airport (HCMC) accounted for 81 percent of total trade (figure 2.9).

The rapid increase in flows through air gateways compared to other types of gateways coincides with a strong growth of production, export, and import of smaller volumes of higher value goods, such as mobile phones, electronic components, high fashion export, and high- value processed agricultural products. This shift is primarily due to Vietnam\u2019s deepened participation in GVC and significant influx of FDI, strategically located nearby these airports. As a result, air cargos in Vietnam are now dominated by electronics and electrical equipment\u2014which rose from 52.3 percent of total air cargo in 2011 to 75.9 percent in 2016 (see table 2.1). A handful of FDIs are responsible for these trends and cargo composition. The composition of exports and imports at both airports and seaports is changing, though not drastically. As presented in table 2.1 and table 2.2, between 2011 and 2016, the lists of most imported and exported products through airports and seaports remain largely unchanged except for a few products.

        "text": "the General Department of Vietnam Customs. TABLE 2.2. Import and Export Products through Vietnam Seaports Key gateways face three-pronged challenges: capacity constraints at major gateways, connectivity constraints to the transport network, and demand-supply mismatch. Each is explored in detail below. The rapid increase in cargo handled through major airports\u2014at 10.8 percent per year during 2009\u201317 (in terms of value)\u2014poses an increasing pressure on airport capacity, with respect to their runways, terminals, and affiliated logistics facilities. Industry stakeholders, including the logistics service sector, shippers, and cargo owners often raise their concerns of aggravating congestion at Vietnam\u2019s airports, especially at Tan Son Nhat airport in HCMC. In fact, the Government of Vietnam has long recognized this issue and has allocated significant funding for capacity expansion and efficiency improvements in major airports as well as construction of new airports, notably the planned development of Long Thanh airport in an eastern suburb of HCMC. Given the time-sensitivity involved with handling high-value air cargos, sufficient capacity\u2014both physical and operational\u2014would be essential to meet the growing demand resulting from the Vietnam\u2019s evolving global value chains. Hinterland connectivity around major gateways, particularly road connections to and from major ports, is also limited. Assessment of travel speed data from various sources, including from the commercial vehicle tracking system (CVTS) data provided by the Directorate for Roads of Vietnam 41 Chapter 2: Integrating with Global Markets(DRVN), shows the impacts of traffic congestion in the transport network around major gateways (see the section titled \u201cChallenges and Opportunities for Logistics Services\u201d in chapter 3 for further details). Congestion is particularly severe around HCMC\u2019s Tan Son Nhat airport and the HCMC seaport complex (including Cat Lai port), the two major facilities located closest to high-density urban areas. On the major connecting roads around these facilities, heavy truck traffic and urban commuter traffic"

Given the conflicting interests between heavy truck traffic and urban commuters, such measures do not offer a sustainable solution. A more comprehensive congestion mitigating solution could include development of various logistics facilities such as urban distribution centers, warehousing, and development of public transport systems for commuters currently relying on private transport modes. Similar challenges apply to intermodal connectivity around Vietnam\u2019s inland waterway transport, which forms an integral part of trade corridors. Many of Vietnam\u2019s river ports and terminals along Vietnam\u2019s extensive inland navigation system are poorly connected to the main road or rail network. Moreover, many seaports lack capacity to efficiently handle transshipment to and from inland waterway vessels, creating capacity bottlenecks and increasing transport costs. For instance, some ports in Vung Tau seaport complex were built with limited berth capacity for handling IWT vessels, as at the time, planners anticipated that most traffic would come through land via the road network. When the ports started operation in 2011, however\u2014partly due to the delayed construction of the connecting roads and partly to the lower transport costs on IWT compared to roads\u2014much more cargo arrived by barges than by trucks. This created unexpected, yet serious capacity chokepoints for container cargo handling, which were later relieved through construction of additional port berths for IWT vessels.5 Obvious imbalance exists between demand and supply at Vietnam\u2019s various seaports. Operating at or near capacity, the two historically important seaports\u2014HCMC seaport complex and Haiphong seaport complex\u2014continue to handle most of Vietnam\u2019s trade volume. Meanwhile, the newer development in Vung Tau seaport complex is operating much below the designed capacity; some of the container terminals, especially those in the inner coast where the water is"

Nevertheless, signs point to these deep-sea ports gaining competitiveness through their natural advantages (for example, water depth) and continued efforts to improve service and lower prices, as shown in table 2.3.

Given these dynamics, in addressing the demand-supply mismatch, Vietnam\u2019s gateway strategy should be driven by a network perspective, not by the perspective of individual ports and airports. While the seaports currently dominating the market have demonstrated they can provide highly efficient services to their customers (as seen by the strong market inertia), they also have limited room to expand capacity. Moreover, Vietnam could potentially realize a significant gain by having a vibrant transshipment facility able to call large vessels with intercontinental capacity. With increasing trade and container volumes, direct intercontinental shipment could significantly reduce transit time. For instance, the transit time from the Haiphong International Container Terminal at Lach Huyen\u2014if ships go through transshipment ports such as Hong Kong SAR, China or Singapore\u2014would be 32 to 35 days to the east coast of the United States, and 28 to 30 days to Europe. Calling an intercontinental mother ship into Lach Huyen would reduce the transit time by around five days, to approximately 27 to 30 days to the east coast of the United States, and 23 to 25 days to Europe.7 Currently, every week the Vung Tau seaport complex operates around 13 direct services to the United States and two to Europe. Industry stakeholders predict that with continued good services and connectivity, these ports have the potential to further increase operations. A shift toward deep-sea, international transshipment facilities would go hand-in-hand with cargo consolidation for export and import, which may require redefining the roles of Vietnam\u2019s smaller ports to focus more on domestic coastal shipping to and from these international terminals. Such an arrangement, resembling a \u201chub-and-spoke\u201d structure, would mean a need to further develop domestic shipping routes, to provide a more vibrant role to smaller ports in moving cargos by sea to key coastal cities in Vietnam, rather"

Selected Statistics on Vietnam\u2019s Industrial Parks, 2018 Economic Clusters and Corridor Development Ample empirical evidence suggests that agglomeration and clustering in space enhances productivity and economic efficiency. The spatial economy of Vietnam has major concentrations of economic activity in its two economic centers, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, which collectively account for more than 60 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Industrial parks, the most prevalent instrument for manufacturing and industrial growth in Vietnam,8 are also concentrated around these two cities. This section seeks to understand how economic clustering relates to trade and transport connectivity and how Vietnam can reap the benefits of agglomeration for its future trade competitiveness. Particularly, we explore the relationship between the placement of industrial parks and the following four elements of connectivity: (a) to transport corridors, (b) to labor markets (urban centers), (c) to other industrial clusters, and (d) to international gateways. In order to obtain granular insights, we based the analysis on zones located in the northern part of Vietnam, and especially in the Red River Delta. Industrial and processing zones, also known as industrial parks, specialize in manufacturing of industrial products and supporting services. Occupying defined geographical areas, the total number of industrial parks (IPs) has increased from 264 in 2010, with 75 percent in operation, to 376 in 2018, with around 86 percent operational (table 2.4). In total, some 499 industrial parks have been designated in nearly all provinces, though they are unevenly distributed. Among these parks, only a few high-tech enterprises have been established to support scientific and technology research and training. In"

While no concrete data is available to test the causes, increasing congestion along the NH5 necessitated the planning and construction of the expressway\u2014which since launching in 2015 has reduced the travel time between the two cities by about two hours. Perhaps not coincidentally, rising congestion and the halt in further investments into new IPs along this corridor share a common cause for agglomeration reaching a saturation point, thereby prohibiting any additional development. The below provides IP characteristics in the northern part of the country. As expected, industrial parks are located in proximity to major transport corridors; however, due to the endogeneity, it is impossible to establish the causal relationship between them. As shown in figure 2.13, over 50 percent of the industrial parks are located within one kilometer (line of sight) from the nearest transport corridor and almost 80 percent are located within two kilometers. Over time these industrial parks have attracted significant investments into their operation, first driven by foreign investors, but later (from 2003 on) more strongly by domestic investors, as depicted in figure 2.14. Industrial parks are closely located with one another, suggesting gains stemming from agglomeration.9 The distance to other industrial parks has consistently decreased over time as new parks were built in proximity to existing parks. Figure 2.14 shows the average and minimum distances of industrial parks established within a five-year period to all earlier-established parks. Clearly, the proximity has decreased sharply, from 126 km in 1995 (with only two operational IZs) to around 1 km in 2009, with more than 58 operational parks.

Most of the industrial parks are located near Hanoi or Haiphong, two of the big urban centers in northern Vietnam. Cities also offer access to research and development networks and other forms of knowledge sharing that can benefit the industrial parks. However, industrial parks are not necessarily located as closely to the nearest ports or airports as they are to transport corridors and cities; in fact, most IPs are located approximately 150 to 175 km from Haiphong port. This suggests that longer distances to port could be compensated by connectivity to labor supply and various inputs, access to other infrastructures, and generally good connectivity to more distant locations.

Distance of Industrial Parks to Various Locations 47 Chapter 2: Integrating with Global MarketsMoreover, land-based border crossing points to neighboring countries seem not to attract conventional industrial parks, with most IPs located relatively far from border points. However, after Vietnam created dedicated border economic zones near the border-crossing points, firms that specifically benefit from the proximity to border-crossing points have moved operations to these specialized industrial zones. These patterns reflect the influence of other variables, including the availability and price of land as well as the location decisions of individual provinces. The analysis shows no direct correlation between the size of industrial parks and their locations. In addition, parks are neither larger or smaller if closer to cities, gateways, or the corridor. Industrial park employment is also not affected by the location to urban centers or the proximity to other industrial parks. Subject to provincial planning processes and land availability, industrial park size is likely influenced by factors outside this analysis. Lastly, the importance of regional connectivity to trading gateways is expected to grow with Vietnam integrating in large trading networks such as the Belt and Road Initiative. The seaport complex of Hai Phong, part of the maritime silk route system, will play a major role, which might increase the importance of Haiphong and Hanoi as well as the industrial parks catering to export- oriented businesses. Based on the above known characteristics of IPs and the agglomeration history of IPs along the NH5 corridor, we hypothesize that investments in major interurban corridors provide new opportunity for economic clustering. This hypothesis is founded on the understanding that economic distance\u2014not physical distance\u2014determines"

Before the expressways were built, Vietnam\u2019s national highway system provided interrupted connections (that is, connections intersecting with local roads at grade) through urban areas. Even without factoring in congestion, the average travel speed hovered around 30 km per hour, and even lower for heavy duty vehicles. The slow travel speed increased the need for businesses to locate as closely to NH5 as possible, to shorten the economic distance to the major port and urban areas. However, development of expressways or other comparable major interurban connectivity infrastructure changes this equation. Now, with this infrastructure shortening the economic distance between points, firms can locate around a major junction well-connected with many useful locations. In other words, improved connectivity enlarges the potential land areas that might be considered suitable for economic clustering. See box 2.2 for an example of successful air and road hub connectivity in Memphis, Tennessee. Due to a lack of integration between the process for developing economic clusters and that for developing transport, such consideration is not yet formally reflected in the existing planning and investment mechanisms in Vietnam, primarily due to the surrounding institutional structure. After the national government sets the target number of parks to develop, provinces screen, appraise, select, and implement their own industrial parks, providing supportive local infrastructure such as electricity and water supply. Yet, the nationally important interurban transport infrastructure conceived and delivered by the Ministry of Transport is not always informed by comprehensive province- level planning information regarding economic clustering. Conversely, the construction of high-speed, high-capacity corridors creates new well-connected transport nodes; however, land use surrounding these high-value nodes for economic clustering, logistics services, or other purposes that maximize the connectivity benefits requires adequate support by land-use plan and policy to encourage such investments, which in turn"

These trends have been strongly and positively correlated with both economic growth and poverty reduction in Vietnam. \u2022 Vietnam holds comparative advantages over export in several sectors\u2014textile and garments, leather and footwear, electronics, wood products, rice, aquaculture, coffee, rubber, and vegetables and fruits\u2014which collectively account for over 70 percent of Vietnam\u2019s total exports. \u2022 Value chains in the nine sectors\u2014with backward linkages from inputs, production, and main export gateways\u2014have been constructed. In addition, transport links along which the value chains are moved have been identified using input\u2013output tables and various other statistics. \u2022 These value chains and transport links have helped create a map of \u201cvalue-chain critical\u201d transport corridors, on which trade competitiveness of the nine sectors would depend. \u2022 Vietnam\u2019s international trade is predominantly handled at a handful of key airports, seaports, and border-crossing points. With the rapid increase in air cargos, many stakeholders are growing increasingly concerned with the airports\u2019 physical and operational capacities. \u2022 Two historically dominant seaports\u2014in Ho Chi Minh City and Haiphong\u2014currently operate at near capacity, with connecting roads plagued with burgeoning congestion. \u2022 At the same time, the relatively new deep-sea ports in Vung Tau seaport complex and Lach Huyen present opportunities to further consolidate cargo and attract large intercontinental vessels, thus lowering transport costs and transit time.

Their success, measured in terms of investments attracted and employment generated, is affected by connectivity and several other factors. \u2022 As Vietnam develops major high-capacity, high-speed transport networks, such as the North\u2013 South Expressway, and thereby shortens economic distances across the country, broader areas become potential candidates for future economic clusters. At the same time, the areas with already developed clusters might be too congested or too expensive to attract new investment. \u2022 Future investments in major connective infrastructure should therefore closely coordinate with land-use plans to encourage development of surrounding high-value transport nodes for high productivity activities. \u2022 In particular, industrial parks and special economic zones require a comprehensive infrastructure planning since they act as nuclei for future clusters and urban growth. A sound infrastructure environment is crucial to reducing congesting and thus attracting more investments. 50 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityNOTES 1.

Jaffee, Brian G. Mtonya, and Yin Yin Lam The Vietnamese population is growing richer and more urban. The \u201cconsumer class,\u201d which consumes US$5.50 or more per person per day, is rapidly expanding from about 49 percent in 2010 to over 70 percent in 2016. About 89 percent of urban dwellers belong to the consumer class, compared to around 66 percent of the rural population. This emerging group consumes more, and more diverse, traded goods and services than its poorer counterparts. Such changes in consumption patterns, caused by a sharp rise of incomes, mean changes in what is moved where, how, and at what costs. This chapter identifies the key drivers shaping the present and future connectivity needs of emerging consumers and discusses how such needs can be addressed to better integrate domestic markets in Vietnam. 53 Chapter 3: Integrating Domestic MarketsRising Urban Middle-Class Consumers of Vietnam Following international norms,1 Vietnamese households are grouped into five economic classes based on their daily consumption per capita in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars: \u2022 the extremely poor, who live on less than US$1.90 per day \u2022 the moderately poor, whose per capita consumption ranges from US$1.90 to US$3.20 per day \u2022 the economically vulnerable, who consume US$3.20 to US$5.50 per person per day \u2022 the economically secure, consuming US$5.50 to US$15 per"

Beyond the physical connectedness, the changing patterns mean greater demand for sophisticated transport and logistics services, such as traceability, safety, timeliness, and quality. Two defining trends that lead to new connectivity challenges\u2014changing food consumption and emergence of e-commerce\u2014are also interrelated. Income growth and demographic changes have resulted in major shifts in dietary and food expenditure patterns.2 According to the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS), among Vietnam\u2019s urban population, the share of food expenditure for rice has fallen from 25 percent in 2002 to less than 10 percent in 2016. For this population, animal products (meat, eggs, and fish) now account for the largest share of food expenditure\u2014reaching over 38 percent in 2016. These shifts have not been limited to the middle- or upper-income segments of the urban population. In 2002, Q1 households spent 48 percent of their food budgets on rice versus 27 percent for meat and fish. By 2016, rice accounted for only 14 percent of their food spending, while meat and fish accounted for 39 percent. The above trends are supported by a survey conducted by University of Adelaide in 2016\u201317 of 2,000 urban households in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), and two provincial cities. These survey results, depicted in figure 3.2, show even higher share of meat (and eggs) in the provincial cities than in the large national cities. As shown below, more than 60 percent of food expenditures are for fresh perishable foods across all income groups in HCMC and Hanoi and is probably closer to 70 percent once the composition of foods consumed away from home is taken into account. As incomes rise, food expenditures per person see an absolute increase due to what is commonly referred to as \u201cdietary upgrading,\u201d which in Vietnam involves"

Later in the chapter, we examine these increasing e-commerce demands by this consumer class and their implication on connectivity. Challenges and Opportunities around Perishable Foods for the Cities After successfully overcoming food insecurity challenges over the past decades, Vietnam faces a new set of complex, inter-related food problems relate to the supply, distribution, and quality assurance for fresh perishable foods. In urban Vietnam, income gains have resulted in dietary shifts beyond rice on such a magnitude that these fresh foods now account for two-thirds of consumer food expenditures (figure 3.2), nearly double their share in the early 2000s. While much of this consumption and expenditure growth in fresh produce in urban areas has been serviced by Vietnamese farmers and market intermediaries, imports, especially of higher quality or different varieties of produce, have also surged in recent years. This new market presents enormous opportunities for Vietnamese farmers and food business operators, but only if they can meet consumer expectations for quality and safety, mobilize and deliver the products on a timely, reliable and cost competitive basis, and do so with limited negative impact on the environment (World Bank 2016a; Zorya and others 2018).

This presents a problem given the multifaceted risk profile of many perishable foods. As a result, much of the delivery system servicing Vietnam\u2019s major cities for fresh perishable foods experiences very high levels of physical and product quality losses, frequently provides consumers with produce contaminated by chemical or microbiological hazards, and generates negative environmental impacts.

For urban consumers, conveniently located wet markets and informal street markets offer a wide range of (generally very fresh) fruits, vegetables, and animal products, flexible packaging sizes, and negotiable prices. Most shoppers walk to these venues or carry small loads on bicycles or motorbikes. Traditional vendors have very low rental and operational costs, which help them keep prices low. On the other hand, shopping at modern markets often requires more time and distance. Only a small proportion of mostly higher income urban residents, who self-claim to be conscious about quality and food safety, regularly purchase fresh produce in supermarkets, where produce tends to be less diverse and less fresh, yet often more expensive than in the traditional outlets. Benchmarking the status quo In a modernizing domestic market for high value perishable foods, effective connectivity includes\u2014and extends well beyond\u2014efficient product handling and logistics, meaning the physical management of product flows from rural areas to end users (and even beyond with the disposal or repurpose of unconsumed food). It also involves effective farm-to-market information flows pertaining to the product as well as its origins, quality characteristics, biosecurity status, and its production processes. Multiple functions must be undertaken and relationships developed to regularize or institutionalize all of this. In fact, a well-connected, well-performing market system"

Now, considering market infrastructure: Most of Vietnam\u2019s approximately 83 food wholesale markets and nearly 2,000 community wet markets, which continue to account for bulk of perishable food sales in the country, are 20 to 30 years old. In addition, the vast majority have not undergone recent renovations to improve hygiene, waste management, or foot and vehicular access. Take the case of \u201ccold chain,\u201d which refers to refrigerated transportation and storage of perishable foods\u2014essential to ensure safety and freshness of food. Vietnam\u2019s cold-chain market has grown rapidly in recent years to reach an estimated market size of US$169 million (FiinGroup 2019). However, most cold storage operations serve the export market; while cold transportation segment is rapidly growing, the market is highly fragmented with many small players who have limited financial capabilities. While Vietnam has implemented a vast set of laws, regulations, and guidelines around the market chain for perishable foods, enforcement gaps persist. Multiple ministries and levels of government have been designated to handle or share the mandates to induce, prohibit, or constrain various types of practices and behavior across all stages and players in the farm-to-market chain for perishable foods.3 Despite the presence of this regulatory framework, the main challenge relates to enforcement or the lack of effective incentives to induce widespread voluntary compliance with regulations. With its highly fragmented structure of food production, intermediation, and distribution, full regulatory oversight is impossible given the current human and financial resources available to government. And, in many ways, broad regulatory enforcement has not been an operative objective in Vietnam\u2019s agro-food system. For decades, the overriding goal has been output expansion with an emphasis placed on intensification. Any misuse of inputs or adverse environmental externalities have"

The consequences of poor connectivity and practices A growing body of evidence points to inefficiencies in domestic value chains for perishable foods as well as serious problems related to food safety and environmental management. This translates into significant economic and social costs and in low levels of consumer confidence and satisfaction. The latter, if not effectively addressed, could weaken the competitiveness of Vietnamese farms and food enterprises in the longer term. Some of this evidence is highlighted here. For example: 60 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityFirst, physical food loss throughout the food chain is significant due to fragmented distribution systems, including the lack of cold storage or refrigerated transport services. A 2018 survey of 150 farmers and enterprises who are prominent suppliers of fresh produce to the HCMC market shows estimated physical product losses of nearly 25 percent, including 32 percent for fruit and vegetables, 14 percent for meat, and 12 percent for fish, only until intermediate distribution points. Estimated losses could be far greater if totals included those incurred during the food processing and final retail distribution phases. Very little use of cold storage or refrigerated transport services occurs in the domestic market, especially the market servicing the traditional distribution channels.4 If these rates of product loss represent the national picture, then total national losses of such high-value perishable foods would amount to nearly US$3.9 billion, equivalent to 12 percent of Vietnam\u2019s agricultural GDP and 2 percent of its total GDP. Second, the supply chain for perishable foods is generating enormous amounts of food and other organic waste; much of this waste is mismanaged which results in significant environmental consequences and high economic costs. In urban Vietnam few active programs exist to"

In HCMC, for example, only about 10 percent of food waste, more than 80 percent of the volume of HCMC\u2019s landfill, is collected and converted into compost; none is converted to industrial uses or bioenergy (Ngoc, Nguyen, and Ngoc 2018). The three wholesale markets in HCMC spend more than US$100,000 per month dealing with garbage or treating waste. Food waste often ends up in canals, ponds, and other surface waters, clogging waterway traffic and contaminating water used for drinking, recreation, or fishing. Thus, instead of being mobilized as a valuable resource, organic waste imposes large environmental and economic costs. Third, mixing cities and animals has translated into a biosecurity risk. A long-standing preference for purchasing \u201cwarm\u201d meat has resulted in large movements of live animals to Vietnamese cities and their slaughter in close vicinity to residential areas. Each day, some 150,000 chickens are moved, sold, and slaughtered in both Hanoi and HCMC. On an annual basis this translates into 55 million chickens. Many of these are channeled through live bird markets, which are typically responsible for transmission of avian influenza that threatens public health (Fournie and others 2012). City food systems and food waste are also likely playing a significant role in the spread of African Swine Fever (for which no known controls exist) and which results in 100 percent mortality for affected pigs. ASF can be spread not only by infected animals, but also through raw meat transported from place to place, converted into feed scraps, or found in organic waste. Fourth, marketed perishable foods have high rates of microbiological and chemical contamination, with the most serious issues related to meat. For example, in a recent study, Nguyen"

The Salmonella prevalence rate was higher in wet markets (90 percent) than in supermarkets (53 percent). Ministry of Health statistics indicate that over the 2011 to 2016 period, seven foodborne diseases impacted an average of 669,000 people per year (National Assembly 2017). Other estimates, taking into account a broader range of foodborne diseases, suggest that more than 61 Chapter 3: Integrating Domestic Marketsten times this number of Vietnamese citizens are sickened (and 3,500 people die) each year from unsafe food. In fact, the proportional incidence of foodborne illness per 100,000 people is higher in Vietnam than in any other country in Asia.5 The public health burden of foodborne disease in Vietnam is now on par with that of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDs. Jaffee and others (2019) estimate that Vietnam\u2019s annual productivity loss (due to loss of work, disability, and premature death) from foodborne disease amounts to some US$740 million per year. The medical costs of treating foodborne illness in Vietnam likely exceed US$200 million per year. Given the above, not surprisingly, Vietnamese consumers rate food safety as their number one social concern. A growing number of recent surveys have sought to gauge consumer attitudes and concerns about food. While some surveys reveal concerns about matters of nutrition and dietary quality, by far the strongest and most widespread concerns pertain to food safety. Remarkably, the lack of trust in the local food safety is almost universal. A 2018 survey conducted in multiple Vietnamese cities found 89 percent of respondents characterizing local food as \u201cunsafe,\u201d echoing a 2016 survey that found middle- and upper-income consumers in Hanoi to either be worried (30 percent) or"

An April 2019 survey of social concerns among Hanoi and HCMC households ranked food safety as the number one concern, far outpacing issues of pollution, access to social services and education, and other issues. Vietnam is likely the only country in the world where such a large number of citizens rank food safety the number one social concern. The above economic, environmental, and public health issues associated with food safety are likely to continue to increase over time, along with further dietary changes toward intrinsically more hazardous foods. Therefore, it is critical to overhaul the perishable food chains in all aspects, ranging from the regulatory framework and investments in market infrastructure, to transportation and logistics services and an enforcement system. Emergence of E-Commerce in Vietnam As is the rest of the world\u2019s economies, Vietnam\u2019s economy is heading toward the \u201cdigital economy,\u201d with its economic entities\u2014producers and consumers alike\u2014increasingly reliant on various digital technologies for information gathering, communication, transactions, and decision- making.

OECD defines e-commerce as the \u201csale or purchase of goods or services conducted over a computer network by methods specifically designed for the purpose of receiving or placing of orders,\u201d while WTO defines e-commerce as \u201cthe production, distribution, marketing, sale, or delivery of goods and services by electronic means.\u201d The digital technologies driving this transition toward the digital economy provide opportunities for growth and enhance inclusivity, by increasing productivity of firms, lowering costs of information and transactions, and lowering information barriers.

At the same time, digital technologies alone are not sufficient to bring about these positive outcomes; rather, the \u201canalog\u201d foundation, such as right regulations, adequate skills and strong institutions would enable the countries to reap such benefits (World Bank 2016b). Projections show e-commerce in Southeast Asia, including in Vietnam, growing rapidly. According to one estimate, the e-commerce market in Southeast Asia is estimated to grow from US$23.2 billion (gross merchandise value) in 2018 to US$102 billion by 2025 (Google and Temasek 2018). The three largest e-commerce firms in the region\u2014Lazada, Shopee, and Tokopedia\u2014grew collectively between 2015 and 2018 by a factor of seven, while the next seven largest players grew by a factor of two during the same time. This rapid growth in e-commerce has been fueled by growing incomes, consumer demand and preferences, increased mobile penetration, and improving logistics networks. This growth is also expected to change the dynamics of competition and growth. E-commerce players are expected to expand from major cities such as Hanoi and HCMC to secondary cities such as Can Tho and rural areas with lower e-commerce penetration\u2014but higher growth potential\u2014making connectivity and logistics more important for sector growth going forward.

As noted in a recent World Bank report, the acceleration of Southeast Asian e-commerce has been facilitated by the surge of marketplaces where SMEs sell to consumers by providing scalable, readily-accessible platforms where smaller retail players and merchants can transact online and reach new consumers (World Bank forthcoming). Most e-commerce merchants in Vietnam are involved in food products, electronics, and clothing and footwear; a majority (58 percent) of e-commerce merchants sell and buy online, while 32 percent only sell online. A number of sectors participating in the Vietnam e-commerce ecosystem have uneven market conditions and levels of development. Facilitating a large number of small-size e-commerce firms to deliver goods and services in a timely, cost-efficient, and convenient manner to customers, requires a well-functioning e-commerce ecosystem made up of players in various interrelated sectors.

The innovative models of digital freight aggregators use information and communication technology for an algorithmic, real-time matching of supply-demand and route optimization, and can help in reducing backhauls as well as improving the efficiency of the truck sector in general. Freight consolidation could also potentially find work-arounds for seasonality, and other unavoidable factors contributing to empty backhauls and lighter truckloads during certain months of the year. Emerging Challenges and Opportunities for LSP Last-mile delivery is the final segment of the logistics chain where goods are transferred from the fulfillment center of the Business to Customer\u2019s (B2C) home or collection point. Timeliness, reliability, cost, and convenience in delivery are becoming increasingly important factors in last-mile delivery for e-commerce companies. The growth of e-commerce has led to a growing number of smaller parcels, leading to increasing logistics challenges. For urban deliveries, the challenges for urban logistics include traffic and congestion, truck access, and off-hour delivery. In contrast, cost, distance, and lack of facilities and infrastructure comprise the challenges of rural deliverables. While larger e-commerce firms can afford their own fleets (that is, 1PL), most e-commerce firms use a combination of 1PL, 2PL, and 3PL\u2014and in limited cases\u20144PL. Postal services are adapting to the rise of e-commerce and companies such as Vietnam Post and Viettel Post are taking advantage of these new opportunities to increase revenue. A specific challenge for postal services and other last-mile delivering companies is whether parcels can be delivered or picked up at home addresses. According to the Universal Postal Union, 80 percent of the population of Vietnam have access to home delivery of mail; Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines have higher rates.

Some of these express services companies have set up specific e-commerce divisions to service e-commerce clients and some e-commerce companies, for example, Lazada Express, have also entered the express services market. Many foreign courier companies currently operating in Vietnam such as DHL, FedEx, Kerry Express, and other courier companies have dedicated terminals located at Tan Son Nhat airport. However, the majority of goods shipped by these companies are parcels and correspondence, so the volume of goods handled by these companies accounts for a relatively small proportion of total airfreight cargo volume in tons. With the rise of e-commerce, the contribution of the courier segment to total airline output will continue to increase in the future. The Vietnamese airfreight market has grown by an average of 15.6 percent between 2011 and 2017 and stood at 1.1 million tons in 2017. While airfreight accounts for a small portion of 69 Chapter 3: Integrating Domestic Marketstotal goods volume in Vietnam, it accounts for 25 percent of the total export value of the country (mostly products such as electronics and textiles). Domestic airfreight accounts for about 20 percent of total airfreight, having grown at an average annual growth rate of around 10 percent from 2011 to 2017 (figure 3.12). The total volume of domestic goods reached approximately 230.5 thousand tons, an increase of 14.6 percent compared to 2016, with the highest share in Ho Chi Minh City (42.6 percent), Hanoi (39.3 percent), and Da Nang (6 percent).

The remaining airports have no cargo terminals and handle cargo in passenger terminals. Domestic aviation firms are expanding, albeit from a low base (with a market share of 12 percent in 2017), in comparison to foreign firms. These domestic firms generally use passenger aircraft underbellies instead of dedicated freighter aircraft. And while e-commerce is increasing it use of airfreight, the volume is still very small. Challenges of urban logistics8 With the rapid growth of cities such as HCMC and Hanoi, we must study the challenges around urban logistics\u2014which often involve trips under 100 km\u2014and the opportunities therein for improving operational efficiency and links with intercity freight movement. Companies involved in urban trucking are often the first- and last-mile delivery partners of intercity transportation companies. Some of the shorter trips (under 100 km) include the \u201cdrayage\u201d of intermodal (or ISO) containers between a maritime or river port and its immediate urban and industrial hinterland. This section discusses the key challenges in the urban trucking operations through analyzing case examples of the two major metropolitan gateways, Hanoi and HCMC, focusing on the current traffic congestion, city regulations affecting the traffic flows, and the upcoming infrastructural plans.230.5905.31,135.8 10.017.4 15.6 -2468101214161820 - 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 Domestic airfreight International airfreight Total airfreight PercentageThousand tons2017 (thousands) 2011-2017 Growth rate (%)FIGURE 3.12.

Therefore, urban trucking companies face high levels of passenger traffic when running logistics services within the city, with over 70 percent of the road users riding mopeds. In addition, car ownership is also expected to rise, due to increasing disposable incomes. Together, the passenger and cargo traffic lead to high levels of congestion in the city. Government studies calculate that traffic jams in Hanoi cause VND 12.6 trillion (US$600 million) in economic losses every year (Saigoneer 2017). Analysis of the Directorate for Roads of Vietnam\u2019s (DRVN) commercial vehicle tracking system, or CVTS, show high congestion patches, particularly in the city center (figure 3.13). Hanoi also acts as a transit stop for importers and exporters operating out of the Haiphong port. Hanoi offers office space, and many logistics companies and distributors have opened offices and warehouses in the city center. Goods from Haiphong port are brought to the Hanoi-based warehouses and then dispatched throughout Vietnam, adding to the city\u2019s traffic congestion. However, building warehouses and consolidation centers near Haiphong port or in the city\u2019s outskirts would prevent this import\u2013export traffic from moving into and out of the city, thus reducing congestion. Another major source of cargo traffic derives from the logistics operations of e-commerce companies as well as the daily deliveries of restaurants, grocery stores, and other small enterprises. Interviews with logistics companies indicate inefficient intra-city road structures, insufficient overpasses, underpasses, and bridges, which all lead to high congestion levels. In such circumstances, city planning and zoning take on a greater importance, clarifying the need for the clear demarcation of commercial, industrial, and residential zones. Residential neighborhoods around industrial areas create challenges surrounding the combination of cargo and passenger traffic. FIGURE 3.13.

Cargo truck movement in the city is only allowed during off-peak hours from 9:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m., which reduces peak-hour traffic congestion. However, the restricted timings also lead to congestion at city entry points during the restricted hours. Urban consolidation centers (UCCs) located at the city fringes serve as potential sites for freight consolidation for goods moving out of the city as well as freight deconsolidation into smaller trucks for goods moving into the city. In addition, UCCs could provide organized parking spaces for the larger trucks during restricted hours. Case study 2: Ho Chi Minh City HCMC is one of the densest cities in Vietnam, with approximately 4,000 people per sq. km of area. The CVTS data analysis of the province shows high congestion in the central city (see figure 3.14). Factors attracting industries include the geographical advantages of HCMC with seaports and river ports and the availability of good quality human resources. While the population growth rate is a modest 1.46 percent, the migration rate is relatively high, at 3.8 percent per year. Because HCMC is an economic hub for Vietnam, a huge number of vehicle users come to the city, piling pressure onto the traffic infrastructure. Due to the presence of rivers, the region is also prone to seasonal flooding, which further adds to the city\u2019s traffic challenges. A unique feature of HCMC\u2014which distinguishes its traffic management from Hanoi\u2014is the proximity of both Ho Chi Minh seaport complex and Tan Son Nhat airport to the city center"

The HCMC seaport complex is one of the most important ports for export and import in the country and serves as the main gateway for the region, accounting for 67 percent of the total throughput of all ports in Vietnam. Trucks used for the first- or last-mile delivery of containers and bulk goods from city ports into city centers contribute to the high levels of congestion. FIGURE 3.14.

Consequently, these port access roads could benefit from additional lanes dedicated to moving cargo traffic. Further, the Cai Mep\u2013Thi Via port, an underutilized deep-water port located around 80 km south of HCMC, can handle more throughput from the Ho Chi Minh port. Truck traffic in HCMC is also subject to timing restrictions. Laws recently put in place by the HCMC People\u2019s Committee restrict light trucks from entering the city\u2019s urban area during peak hours from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. In addition, heavy trucks and container trucks are not allowed in urban areas from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. As discussed in the Hanoi case study, UCCs could potentially offer organized space for parking trucks and consolidating freight during restricted hours.

Cities have daunting challenges of ensuring their citizens meet their daily mobility needs\u2014such as commuting and other trips\u2014while at the same time enabling goods movement for businesses and households, especially in light of increasing e-commerce. These issues are not easy to solve or inexpensive as regulations alone would not be sufficient to resolve them.

And thus, the food supply chains around the largest cities of Vietnam continue to rely on traditional wet markets and fragmented logistics chains, which lack the ability ensure necessary conditions for freshness and safety of fresh food. \u2022 As a result, Vietnam\u2019s cities and their residents face some serious challenges, including massive loss of food during the supply chain, endemic issues around food safety due to various forms of contamination occurring throughout the supply chain, and a wide range of environmental pollution caused by unhygienic slaughtering practices in close proximity with urban density. \u2022 Tackling such"

However, with the sector still at an early stage of growth and dominated by SMEs, creating an enabling environment is necessary. \u2022 Along with its potential benefits, e-commerce also brings additional challenges, such as growing needs for new types of logistics services, involving door-to-door connectivity, last- mile delivery, and urban storages able to meet the demand yet provide proximity. All of these issues bring further challenges in Vietnam\u2019s fast-growing, congested cities, which also need to address conflicting urban mobility issues concerning daily commuters. \u2022 Domestic air freight is growing rapidly due to income rises and emergence of e-commerce. While the current volumes are sufficiently handled in passenger plane cargo holds, this might not be sustainable in the long-term as volumes are rising, and seasonality of freight demand is not consistent with passenger demand. The limited cargo handling capacities at most domestic airports could also pose challenges for sector growth. \u2022 Urban logistics in Vietnam\u2019s already built-up and congested large cities pose serious challenges to various stakeholders with conflicting needs.

MARD enforces rules related to the sale and use of agricultural inputs and shares with MoNRE oversight on how water and land is allocated and used. The operative Food Law designates different responsibilities for food safety oversight to MARD, Ministry of Health (MoH), and Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT), with distinctions across product lines and food system players. The MoT and municipal governments oversee regulations regarding the types of vehicles which may be used for transporting food and animals and restrictions on time or locations for vehicular movements. 4. Cold-chain warehousing capacity is estimated to have quadrupled over the past ten years, reaching approximately 450,000 pallets in 2017, with an estimated 20 professional cold storage providers in southern Vietnam and 40 in the north. Much of this storage is used for external trade, the pharmaceutical industry, and by supermarkets. Comparatively, much less investment has gone into refrigerated vehicles due to concerns about road quality, cost, intermittent use, ability to withstand high external temperatures, and lack of understanding of its full benefits (see Walsh 2018). 5. The best available estimates probably come from the work of the WHO-convened Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG). Its findings were reported on a subregional rather than country-specific level. See Havelaar and others 2015. 6.

However, physical connection alone is not sufficient for reducing economic distance, as the connection must also link to areas that provide economic opportunities with sufficient economic density. This chapter examines how economic opportunities are spatially distributed in Vietnam, how different parts of the country are connected to these economic opportunities, and how and to what extent connectivity has affected their economic well-being. 79 Chapter 4: Delivering on \u201cLast-Mile\u201d Inclusion Spatial Variation of Economic Densities and Outcomes in Vietnam As urbanization and agglomeration continues, the already uneven distribution of population and economic activities in Vietnam is becoming more uneven. Vietnam is characterized by very low-density areas in the northern mountains and central highlands bordering Lao PDR and Cambodia as well as densely populated areas around Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and Hanoi (figure 4.1A). Economic activity measured in terms of estimated local GDP is even more concentrated than population in the communes of HCMC and Hanoi, as shown in figure 4.1B. The remaining activities spread along the coast and in the southern part of the country. Over the past decade, the most populated areas have grown the most in terms of population size, as a result of continued"

High mountain communes also have a significantly lower population density, at 34 people per square kilometer compared to 257 people per km2 in inland and delta communes. Thus, poverty is much higher in areas with the lowest economic density, presence of firms and access to non-farm wage jobs (table 4.1). Limited access to off-farm opportunities accounts for much of the cross-regional income differences, mirroring the spatial variation in the economic structure within the country. Average incomes are significantly lower in high mountain communes, especially in non-farm wages, household businesses, and remittances categories (figure 4.3). The combined income differential in household businesses and wage earnings alone almost explains the differences in income between high mountain and inland-delta communes. These differences are not only a result of limited participation in off-farm wage jobs, but also due to the much lower average wage earnings in remote areas, reflecting the low-value addition and opportunities in the lagging low and high mountain areas. Improved access to more productive off-farm opportunities is therefore key to closing Vietnam\u2019s spatial disparities in household incomes. In part, this requires overcoming the challenges of remoteness that characterize many of the lagging areas, making improved connectivity a central pillar for equalizing access to opportunities in Vietnam.TABLE 4.1.

See: https://www.gso.gov.vn/default_en.aspx?tabid=515 &ItemID=18977.Conceptual Link between Connectivity and Economic Outcomes At the macro level, uneven distribution of densities is a natural outcome of geography and economic agglomeration. Multiple factors explain the concentration of economic activities in some locations, including the geography of the country, the gains from agglomeration, the access to international gateways, and so on. While workers benefit from concentration through better access to jobs and amenities, and firms benefit from access to production services, consumers, and workers, such concentration also brings pollution, congestion, and higher land prices, which can in turn discourage or constrain further concentration. The relative strengths of the agglomeration and dispersion forces underlying these concentrations of economic activity are central to spatial disparity and other related economic issues. Firm location and investment decisions strongly correlate with economic density and connectivity, which in turn determine availability of wage jobs. Data from the 2016 economic census show fewer firms in remote areas. Two-thirds of communes without an enterprise in 2016 are located in mountainous areas. The smaller market means fewer opportunities for easy-to-start household enterprises, most of which concentrate in the retail and trade services sectors. An average of four service sector enterprises operate in communes with fewer than 10,000 people, compared to an average of"

The average firm is also smaller in less populated communes, averaging 16 workers per firm in communes with fewer than 10,000 people, and about 36 workers per firm in communes with between 30,000 and 40,000 people. Similarly, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Vietnam is largely concentrated in high density population areas (see figure 4.5). However, some less populated provinces with better market access due to good connectivity or proximity to international gateways (for example, China in the north) have become incipient recipients of FDI. As a result, far fewer wage jobs are available in remote areas (figure 4.6). Remoteness and low density contribute to the lack of economic opportunities in Vietnam\u2019s lagging areas. Structurally, the lagging areas of Vietnam\u2014further away from economic hubs, yet much more sparsely populated\u2014have low market access. By reducing local potential for job creation and/or reducing household incentives to participate in off-farm activities, the low market access can in turn be a limiting factor to households\u2019 access to better jobs.

Examples in Vietnam include forestry products and ecotourism in the northern mountain regions. Second, with small local markets, growth in economic activities is driven by external demand, either domestic (from cities and other regions), and/or international, for example, in niche products and services or tourism. Third, growth is mostly delivered by small and medium enterprises (SMEs), since it is often difficult to achieve scale in low-density economies, except for single-firm localities dominated by one large firm that exploits the area\u2019s natural resources, as in the case of mining. Both low labor supply and low local demand due to small population size can limit scale in this case. Connectivity is key to both maximizing the benefits of agglomeration and overcoming the challenges of remoteness and low density by reducing economic distances between firms, people, and markets. Transport connectivity is central to understanding how people and firms locate across space and defines how regions can access other domestic and global markets. Better connectivity will reduce frictions hampering growth and improves access for lagging regions to the rest of the country and global markets. Given the above spatial distribution of people and economic activities in Vietnam, the transport network quality will matter in connecting the main growth poles, in connecting the secondary cities to these main growth poles, in connecting lagging regions to growing regions, and in connecting these regions to the main international gateways.

        "text": "low-density economies depend on improved connectivity to link them into the network economy, thus enlarging the external market crucial for generating growth in low-density economies. With better connectivity and market access, lagging areas could tap into regional and global value chains by attracting maturing industries seeking cost advantages beyond large urban centers. As agglomeration centers evolve into high-value products, some mature industries lose their competitiveness in large urban areas. They then seek to relocate to the periphery, with cheaper labor, rents, and other services. This provides an opportunity for growth in lagging areas, but one that would most likely benefit areas with better connectivity and market access. The shift of garment value chains and other low value-added manufacturing activities have also been biased toward outer provinces with much better access. Besides limiting job creation and thus labor demand, remoteness also creates stronger incentives for households to prioritize food subsistence over non-food production activities (Low 1986). Remote and therefore poorly integrated food markets create a price wedge. Isolated households tend to pay more for food from outside markets because of the high transaction costs. Thus, households in remote areas will have a strong incentive to produce food, at a lower cost, to meet their own consumption requirements. Conversely, any surplus they produce would fetch a low producer price because of the same high costs of marketing the crop outside the area. The result is a low-level subsistence equilibrium, biased toward food production. This affects household labor supply decisions at two levels: (a) crop choice when allocating land among different agriculture activities, and (b) participation rates in off-farm activities when allocating labor. Within agriculture, the price wedge would disincentivize a shift of production to higher-value non-cereal crops, even in areas more agronomically suitable for non-cereals crops.

Thus, low market access can be a limiting factor to off-farm participation by both reducing labor demand and off-farm labor supply. In addition to the impact of access to wage jobs, market access can also explain the variation in real wages across regions. In literature, the regional variation in wages has been attributed to (a) skills sorting, arguing that agglomeration centers attract better-skilled and better-paid workers, (b) increasing returns\u2014external to firms, due to spillovers between firms or human capital externalities, as agglomeration generates greater knowledge spillovers between firms and workers, therefore raising productivity and wages, and (c) non-human factor endowments (Combes, Duranton, and Gobillon 2008; Hanson 2003; Head and Mayer 2006). However, a growing body of literature appeals mainly to transport costs and increasing returns (Redding and Venables 2003; Redding and Venables 2004), arguing that market access accounts in part for the spatial variation in wages across regions. Firms in locations with greater market access face lower transportation costs, which increases their profitability and ability to pay higher wages while remaining competitive. Invoking this argument, Hering and Poncet (2010) finds market access explains a significant part of the interindividual difference in wages in China\u2014after controlling for skills, living costs, firm types, and provincial fixed effects accounting for other place-specific, non- human endowments present in agglomeration centers with higher market access. A large variation in wages is also evident in Vietnam (figure 4.7). Lagging provinces, with lower market access, have significantly lower average wages. Average wages are highest in densely populated areas around the Hanoi\u2013 Haiphong and HCMC economic corridors. Wages are substantially lower in less populated areas further off these"

Better connectivity results in cheaper access to consumers and producers in other districts and increases domestic trade (figure 4.10A). The districts that experienced the largest reductions in average domestic travel time saw the highest increase in trade with other districts. When consumers have access to more and cheaper goods from the rest of the country, producers can sell to more consumers. The connectivity improvement from 2009 to 2017 has slowed down the concentration rate of workers in the main two urban poles, benefiting more distant areas in the northwest and along the coastline. This happened because improvements to the transport network occurred in a relatively even fashion across the country, with significant investments made in some less-developed and lower- density areas. By reducing travel time and improving market access for some less-dense and less-rich areas, changes in the transport network brought large increases in real wages and attractiveness of these areas for workers. As a result, population growth in the districts around Hanoi and HCMC slowed to a lower growth rate. While better connectivity has increased real incomes for all districts, wages have grown faster in the Northwestern and Central Highlands districts of the country (figure 4.9B). While the creation of better opportunities in these districts has slowed down domestic migration toward the two main urban centers, migration to these centers remains the dominant form of rural-urban migration for the country (figure 4.9A).

Accessibility has also improved greatly for communes along the coast line as well as along the major transport corridors where investments have been made. Changes in market access mostly result from changes in transport costs over the last decade. Access to markets depends both on transport costs and the size of the markets that can be reached. Thus, the improvement of market access can be attributed to growing population in Box 4.1.

The total impact on each district can be captured by changes in that commune\u2019s market access.

Over the past decade, gains from the improving transport network have disproportionately benefited the most dense districts, for example, urban centers (figure 4.12). Improvements in transport infrastructure have expanded market access, which in turn increases wage and attracts more population. Keeping population fixed between 2009 and 2017, communes where market access expanded from the improved conditions on the transport network had relatively higher wages and higher population (see box 4.2 for the methodology). On average, a 1 percent increase in market access associates to a 1.23 percent wage increase and a 0.09 percent growth in commune population. Expansion of a commune\u2019s access to more populated communes positively correlates with a higher average wage and higher population density in the commune (table 4.2A).

The discussions in this and the following sections present the key findings from quantitative and econometric analysis (see appendix A for a detailed description of the methodology). The below analysis focuses on the relationships between (a) market access and household access to off-farm jobs and (b) market access and wages. Descriptive evidence suggests a strong correlation between market access and access to off-farm opportunities in Vietnam. As expected, market access is highest in the HCMC and Hanoi\u2013 Haiphong corridors, where the highest concentration in access to off-farm jobs is observed. In the northern mountain provinces, access to off-farm jobs is significantly better in Lao Cai, Yen Ban, and Phu To provinces (figure"

Contrast this to provinces like Dien Bien which are poorly connected and have the lowest number of off-farm wage jobs\u2014at fewer than 15,000 per province. However, descriptive evidence alone is not conclusive due to the presence of confounding factors. Areas with low market access tend to coincide with those populated by an ethnic minority or with lower education attainment, which have been found as important factors (Hoang, Pham, and Uluba\u015fo\u011flu 2014; Newman and Kinghan 2015). Road infrastructure investments are also endogenous to economic potential across areas. A tendency to build roads in areas with high economic potential increases the likelihood of more job creation. The following analysis attempts to isolate and quantify the contributions of market access to household participation in non-agriculture employment activities in rural and peri-urban areas, controlling for the confounding factors. 93 Chapter 4: Delivering on \u201cLast-Mile\u201d InclusionThe result suggests that market access explains a considerable amount, but not all, of the variation in access to off-farm opportunities in lagging areas. Improved market access also mitigates the disadvantage of low population density. Even after controlling for other factors, the local population density accounts for a significant variation in the probability of holding off-farm wage employment. But households living in a low-density population area with market access have far better prospects for a higher-wage job. In high mountain communes for example, the probability of off-farm wage employment nearly doubles for both the lowest and middle densely populated communes as market access improves from less than one standard deviation below the mean, to within a standard deviation above the mean. In low mountain communes, a 48 percent (15 percentage points) increase is observed for the low-density population communes, but only"

About 31 percent of this explained difference\u2014or 29 percent of the overall difference\u2014is due to poorer market access outside inland and delta communes (table 4.3).

This demographic advantage is lower when only comparing locations, meaning that while investment to improve market access can help close the gap in access to off-farm wage jobs between lagging regions and other places, complementary policies are needed to improve access to jobs for ethnic minorities within regions, allowing them to benefit despite their demographic advantage. 95 Chapter 4: Delivering on \u201cLast-Mile\u201d Inclusion Estimates suggest that improved market access can narrow the gender gap in wage job participation. The marginal effects of market access are significantly higher for spouses than for their husbands. In the joint allocation decision model, applied only to a subsample of couples, for example, comparison of the marginal effects of market access on non-farm wage jobs participation is nearly twice as large for spouses than for their husbands. Women in Vietnam are twice as likely to engage in unpaid family work than men, while both our estimates and those in recent literature (Dang, Hiraga, and Nguyen 2019) suggests that women in households with young children are less likely to engage in paid work. That market access can explain a higher variation of wage participation for married women than for their husbands suggests that improving market access helps women access paid jobs more, which in turn could help close the gender gaps in participation in paid work. The positive relationship between market access and wage job participation in Vietnam appears to be influenced more by the impact market access has on job access than by integration of food markets, as the price wedge hypothesis would predict. The price wedge hypothesis argues that due to poorly integrated food"

In fact, evidence in Vietnam suggests the opposite. We compared the share of net-rice buyers based on the number of household members engaged in off-farm work using the VHLSS 2016 data, which indicated the share of rice net-buyers is higher among households with many people engaged in non-farm work in remote highland communes. Similar results found with inland and delta communes (figure 4.15) contradict the notion that disintegrated food markets trap people in agriculture in remote areas. The pattern suggests the need to first meet subsistence needs does not constrain households from seeking off-farm employment. Rather, the low availability of opportunities serves as the limiting factor to household off-farm income generation.Source: World Bank calculations from the 2016 VHLSS, conducted by the GSO.

The pattern is qualitatively the same when estimated using the share of household members working off farm. However, market access does seem to impact land allocation within agriculture in favor of food production. Estimated land-use choice determinants in Vietnam (World Bank 2019) show remote households are more inclined to use a higher share of their land to grow rice and maize than perennial or industrial crops, even in areas where the land is more appropriate for perennial and industrial crops. Compared with the national average, households located approximately 15 km away (equivalent to two standard deviations) from an all-weather commune road devote 16 percent less land to industrial-crop production. The supply response of perennial and industrial crops to relative rice prices is also low, suggesting that while households prefer to diversify their livelihoods into non- farming activities, isolated households will prioritize agricultural activities toward food production. The result creates a low-level subsistence equilibrium, biased toward rice and cereals, which disincentivizes a production shift to higher-value and more agronomically suitable perennial crops. Market access and wage variation The positive correlation between market access and spatial wage variation in Vietnam is consistent with the hypothesis that firms in locations with higher market access pay lower transportation costs, which in turn allows them to pay higher wages. However, other potential alternative mechanisms rely on agglomeration economics to explain the observed impact of market access on wages. These alternative mechanisms include (a) potentially high cost of living in agglomeration centers inducing firms to raise nominal wages (Dekle and Eaton 1999), (b) increasing returns for firms due"

To isolate the impact of market access via the transport cost mechanism in Vietnam, the spatial variation in individual hourly wages is analyzed, accounting for skills, local population density, the cost of living, occupation, industry of employment, and firm ownership type. 97 Chapter 4: Delivering on \u201cLast-Mile\u201d InclusionEmpirical estimates from this analysis show a positive correlation between market access and individual wage variations in Vietnam, most significantly for foreign owned enterprise workers. A one standard deviation increase in market access associates with 11.5 percent higher hourly wages, after controlling for individual education and experience as well as job characteristics (occupation, industry, and provincial fixed effects). The estimate for employees in the domestic private sector is less robust, with wages increasing an estimated 3 percent (for a one standard deviation in market access) without accounting for provincial fixed effects, but show no increase when controlling for provincial fixed effects. However, public sector employees (including state-owned enterprise, or SOEs) are paid more when working in locations with poor market access, consistent with additional allowances for government employees in hard-to-reach areas. Thus, market access appears to account for the variation in wages, predominantly among the FDI sector. The evidence suggests other mechanisms linked to agglomeration significantly account for wage variation. That the impact of market access on domestic private sector wages is insignificant when controlling for provincial fixed effects suggests location specific non-human endowment factors contribute to the spatial variation in wages. The significance of the share of employees with post-secondary education points to the influence of skills sorting, while the significance of median housing values per square meter is consistent with Dekle and Eaton\u2019s postulation (1999) that a"

Over the period from 2009 to 2017, transport costs to reach an international gateway reduced significantly, giving rise to economic gains. Results from a general equilibrium model to evaluate transport interventions (see appendix A for the methodology) provides that\u2014keeping all other factors equal\u2014if the transport network had not changed between 2009 and 2017, income would have been 2.43 percent lower due to less international integration (table 4.5). National welfare, which encompasses benefits other than income, would also have been 3 percent lower. Estimates show these previous investments between 2009 and 2017 have decreased spatial real income inequality and helped spread international integration gains across the territory; the effects heightened when assuming no barriers to labor mobility. Investments under Scenario 1, through connectivity upgrades in remote localities and nearby border gates, would expand opportunities for international trade, thus improving national income while reducing spatial inequality. In an economy where the domestic labor is not mobile, estimates place the increase at 0.2 percent; when assuming no constraint on domestic labor mobility the increase would be lower at less than 0.1 percent, as the relative gain from improved connectivity is lower based on an already mobile domestic labor market. Investments under Scenario 1 would lower spatial inequality of welfare, that is, would support inclusiveness, both with or without mobile labor markets; the decrease would be steeper without barriers to labor mobility (table 4.6).TABLE 4.5.

Impacts of Future Connectivity Improvement\u2014Scenario 1 102 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityCompared to investments around border crossing points, investing in the North\u2013South Expressway would bring larger national gains from domestic connectivity, but smaller gains from better international integration. Investments under Scenario 2 (table 4.7) could potentially grow income by 0.12 percent. However, gains from investments in the North\u2013South Expressway become much larger when workers can easily move toward more attractive regions. High mobility costs would prevent many workers from going toward locations that have benefited the most from better access to international gateways and global markets. Thus, if more workers had relocated over the past decade, the gains from transport investments would have been larger. Under Scenario 2, investments in major economic corridors to connect already established cities would worsen the spatial inequality, if workers cannot relocate freely, as shown in table 4.7. Benefits of better connectivity toward global markets would be enjoyed mostly by localities along the corridor. However, by removing barriers to labor mobility, investments that focus on main economic corridors could reduce spatial inequality and contribute to the inclusive growth. In sum, improvements in connectivity would generate positive impacts on national income, but investment impacts on spatial welfare inequality would depend on the degree of labor mobility barriers. This applies both to the actual transport investments and future scenarios of two very different types of investments\u2014scattered and remote area-focused investments versus those concentrated along a major economic corridor. CHAPTER SUMMARY \u2022 Many spatial variations in multiple dimensions of economic outcomes exist in Vietnam. Greater density areas coincide with greater economic outcomes, such as GDP, employment, wages, incomes, and overall welfare. \u2022 By analyzing the transport network between two time points, from 2009 to"

Generally remote and sparsely populated, the local economies in lagging areas of Vietnam depend mostly on external demand to generate growth and expand access to jobs; therefore, market access is crucial to improving economic opportunities in lagging regions. \u2022 Estimates show improving market access helps mitigate the disadvantage of remoteness and low density in Vietnam\u2019s lagging regions. In high mountain communes, the probability of off- farm wage employment nearly doubles for both the lowest and middle densely populated communes, as market access improves"

Differences in market access account for 22 percent of the observed difference in access to off-farm wage jobs between ethnic minorities and the Kinh and Hoa, and a 29 percent difference in access between the inland delta communes and the other communes. \u2022 To a limited extent, improved market access positively influences the level of wage earnings too, though other mechanisms linked to agglomeration matter more in this regard. Improved market access also positively associates with households allocating more agriculture land to non-cereal crops better suited for their land. Enhanced market access also helps married women access paid work more than it does their husbands, which could help close the gender gap in participation in paid work. \u2022 The analysis modeled two future transport investment scenarios for their possible impacts on income and welfare increase, based on the Government of Vietnam\u2019s announced plans, namely on the North\u2013South Expressway and rehabilitation and upgrading of the national highway system. \u2022 The analysis shows these future investments would increase the welfare and income at all communes; however, increases would be highly uneven. Both scenarios are expected to reduce income inequality, but only without barriers to labor mobility within the country. With barriers, the inequality would worsen or remain the same level. 104 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityNOTES 1.

Therefore, it is important to ensure Vietnam\u2019s infrastructure connectivity is resilient against future climate-induced risks. This chapter provides analytical evidence of increasing risks, while also identifying investments and measures to address these risks. 107 Chapter 5: Building ResilienceResilience and Reliability of Connectivity Vietnam\u2019s extensive transport network is exposed to various hazards, including landslide, fluvial (river) flooding, typhoon and flash flooding, all of which are increasing in intensity and frequency due to climate change (figure 5.1). With two or more natural disaster multihazard events per year, Vietnam ranks high as a natural disaster hotspot, with 60 percent of its land area and 71 percent population exposed to risk (Dilley and others 2005), which could result in annual average asset losses amounting to 1.5 percent of GDP and loss in consumption amounting to 2 percent of GDP (Hallegatte and others 2016). Extreme hazards are expected to intensify with climate change. It is possible that climate change will exacerbate these extreme hazards, even after factoring uncertainties in downscaled global climate model predictions (Irish Aid 2017; MoNRE 2009; World Bank 2011). Examining the spatial patterns of the hazard exposures for nationally important transport networks can offer additional insights.

Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the length of exposed highway would increase to 197 km by 2025 and to 222 km by 2050; under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the exposure length increases to 211 km in 2025 and to 235 km in 2050.2 Under the future RCP4.5 scenario, approximately 720 km to 1,163 km of the national road network would be exposed to extreme river flooding (flooding depth exceeding 1 meter) in the current flooding scenarios; the network exposure lengths would increase to between 786 km and 1,180 km. Similar estimates apply to the railway network, which often runs parallel to primary road network (Oh and others 2019). 108 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityFIGURE 5.1.

Key sea, air, and river ports in Vietnam are similarly exposed to natural hazards and to the risks of major flow disruption, with extreme intensity events becoming more frequent due to climate change. For example, the maximum hazard probability of the Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) seaport complex flooding increases five-folds, from the current 0.04 (1-in-25 years flooding) without climate change to 0.2 (1-in-5 years flooding) under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.

The expected potential economic impacts of disruptions caused by natural hazards could be significant, accounting for increases in transport rerouting costs and production reductions due to input\u2013output links of goods moved on the affected transport link. The expected economic losses in case of various natural hazards can be calculated using a spatial analytical tool; figure 5.2 illustrates the example for the road network. Some transport links, which carry significant traffic yet have few rerouting options, could incur substantial economic loss, with estimates as high as US$20 million. The analysis shows risks along key sections of the QL1A trans-Vietnam highway are predominantly driven by landslides and typhoon flooding, while river flooding affects links around HCMC and Thua Then Hue, while flashfloods affect some mountain provinces due to the underlying hazards concentrated only in those regions.

In addition to the above broader resilience strategy, for the already-built infrastructure, it is important to identify any investments required for rehabilitation, reconstruction, or other engineering solutions needed to mitigate the risks. In the above-referenced World Bank study (Oh and others 2019), the economic costs and benefits have been analyzed for selected engineering solutions commonly used in Vietnam, against the key infrastructure failure cases, such as erosion of pavement or slope, drainage failure, or structural failure (for example, collapse of bridges and culverts). Compared to the existing cost norms and standards, the cost estimates for some of the engineering solutions to \u201cclimate-proof\u201d critical infrastructure could be as much as three times higher than their alternatives, depending on the structure, terrains, and the significance of risk exposure (table 5.1). Investments to upgrade or rehabilitate existing infrastructure would enhance its resilience and help avoid the estimated economic losses. The economic benefits of such investments represent the sum of the avoided annual expected rehabilitation costs for individual road links as well as the avoided expected annual economic losses (EAEL) from disruptions of transport freight flows caused by failures of individual road links, over an analysis period. The results suggest significant benefits of investing into building resilience, particularly along the expressway sections toward the eastern coastline. The benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) of adaptation can then be estimated for all identified road links, comparing the cost of adaptation investments and their economic benefits. The above analysis suggests climate-resilient designs could increase the cost of construction significantly; however, the high"

Greater use of IWT could be encouraged by promoting \u201ccontainer-on-barge\u201d services, which would bring added flexibility for IWT and better compete with trucking. The lack of containerization has resulted in IWT becoming dominated by bulk commodities such as coal, construction materials, fertilizers, and cement. Other major road freight commodities could also potentially be containerized and transported through IWT. Rice offers an example of a commodity with significant potential for containerization; currently, only 4 percent of rice production in the Mekong Delta region is containerized. Among other benefits, containerization brings efficiency gains by facilitating faster transshipment. Recent successful examples in the Mekong Delta region suggest potential for cost reduction through containerization and a shift from road to IWT.3 Well-connected and well-equipped river ports comprise another critical missing link in Vietnam for intermodal connectivity between road and IWT. As discussed in chapter 1, many of the existing river ports are old, poorly-equipped\u2014generally without container-handling facilities\u2014 and poorly-connected to the road network. This aging port infrastructure has discouraged intermodal connections between road and IWT, while also restricting the use of IWT to a few routes connected mostly through waterborne transport. While additional investments in river ports are needed, most of which would be invested in and managed by private entities, two barriers prevent such investments: \u2022 Without public investments to"

Both barriers suggest the need for strong port development coordination between private port operators and provincial or city governments, perhaps warranting a joint development. The potential for domestic coastal, short-sea shipping in Vietnam has not been fully explored. Domestic cargo transportation through coastal shipping accounts for only 39 percent of the total coastal cargo throughput, in part due to the absence of a robust supply ecosystem as well as infrastructural constraints in and around the ports. On the supply side, very few shipping services offer coastal shipping, passing the additional costs, terminal handling charges, for example\u2014 which account for 50 percent of the total coastal shipping costs\u2014along to the client. Currently, terminal handling charges are uniform for both international and domestic cargo. However, ports have traditionally preferred international cargo over domestic cargo, in terms of turnaround time and berth allocation. On the infrastructural end, while the major export\u2013import oriented ports are being updated with the latest cargo-handling facilities, additional policy support could be used to promote Roll-on/Roll-off (RO\u2013RO) vessels with built-in or shore-based ramps. This would enable loaded trucks to roll directly onto ships, transfer through the sea, and then roll off from the ships to the ports. These trucks can then directly proceed to delivery, reducing dependencies on port handling services and dedicated short-haul truck services. At present, RO\u2013RO ships account for 0.04 percent of the cargo throughput from the HCMC port (JICA 2010). 115 Chapter 5: Building ResilienceCHAPTER SUMMARY \u2022 Vietnam is among the countries most"

As presented in chapter 2 of this report, the key sectors\u2019 value chain linkages, covering participating localities and economic clusters that provide inputs or consume final products, can be identified using various economic statistics and mapped on the transport network. Based on this analysis, we recommend that transport planning and investment strategies be informed by this type of spatial analysis, to promote a robust, trade-oriented connectivity policies and investments. At present, the objectives of enhancing trade competitiveness are not explicitly linked with the objectives of improving connectivity. Trade information, especially on value chains, is rarely used in policy formulation. In addition, a lack of in-depth analyses remains on spatial structure and connective propensity along various linked segments of value chains to inform relevant policies and investment for transport infrastructure development. Mainstreaming such an analytical approach for future decision making, beyond what was carried out for this report, first requires creating the entire trade- and transport-link ecosystem.

However, some gateways are situated within built-up urban areas with limited expansion possibilities. The Government of Vietnam has long recognized this issue and plans to build new gateways, such as the planned airport in Long Thanh, that would share the increasing air traffic volume with the existing inner-city airport at Tan Son Nhat. Some major international gateways face serious issues concerning inland connectivity. Existing road corridors often go through the inner city, aggravating congestion with a mix of truck traffic traveling to ports and commuter motorbikes. Several maritime ports have insufficient capacity to handle inland waterway barges, which often provide gateways with critical inland connectivity. Such situations are caused in part by the lack of coordination around development of international gateways and their connectivity; the former is driven by the national government, while the latter is provided by provincial or city authorities, with unmatched budgeting priorities and timeframes. The case of Vung Tau seaport complex, which is built to handle large intercontinental ships but poorly connected both by road and inland waterway, serves as an example. We therefore recommend coordinating transport planning with the explicit objective of strengthening multimodal and intermodal connectivity, strongly emphasizing critical chokepoints and hinterland connectivity around the key gateways. Changes in product-based export structure should also be required priorities when building better logistics and connectivity for higher-value product exports. A transport system aiming to promote export should thus consider this shift of logistics perspectives, especially with regard to prioritizing investment into appropriate types of trade gateways.

In chapter 3, we explored the example of perishable food. Considering the vast negative economic, environmental, and public health consequences of unsafe perishable food, Vietnam needs to upgrade the quality and safety of food production, transportation, and distribution. Notwithstanding the food safety laws and regulations already in place, monitoring and enforcement is extremely resource-intensive because of food chain fragmentation. For more effective regulation around food chain, Vietnam should strengthen the interagency coordination and introduce a risk-based approach. Involving both national and local authorities, regulatory and enforcement coordination is essential between the food certification system and production, sourcing, and transportation and distribution of food. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has appropriately moved to focus oversight efforts on a risk-based approach, in order to prioritize various enterprises and product lines. However, Vietnam cannot police its way to safe and sustainable value chains for perishable foods. The lack of demand for certified food and a refrigerated food chain is not rooted in the lack of demand for safety and quality, but rather in the lack of awareness and knowledge around the certification system, which leads to persistent consumer preference for traditional wet markets. Maintaining unbroken cold chains entails additional costs to the food logistics, and many consumers doubt the resultant price premium is worthwhile. Therefore, greater attention needs to be given to raising awareness and knowledge about safe and unsafe practices and building programs which facilitate"

With few exceptions, these markets have been publicly owned and managed (sometimes contracted to joint stock companies). These owners and managers have faced persistent operating problems because (regulated) rental rates have been held very low, resulting in insufficient income for infrastructure maintenance and day-to-day management. Individual cities appear to be undertaking selective upgrades to some of this infrastructure or making decisions to relocate certain markets, especially wholesale markets, to peri-urban areas in the future. Few of these developments, however, appear to be happening as a broader strategic vision for the markets\u2019 future roles and functions, and possible changes in how they are financed and managed. At the national level, an overall strategy or master plan for wholesale markets would recognize a likely market hierarchy and provide guidance on infrastructure design and options for financing and commercial services. The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) has begun the process of developing such a plan, based upon Decision 6841/QD-BCT, issued in June 2015. The experiences of China and the Republic of Korea in developing similar national master plans should be instructive for Vietnam.

Currently, with few exceptions, matters of needs, risk, and performance of food system and other urban consumption activities are not mainstreamed into urban land-use planning, logistics, environmental management, or overall municipal governance. Most agricultural strategies and plans identify cities as end points for consumption, but not as active, responsible players in governance of supply chains including for food. As a result, while many cities increasingly recognize the above noted problems, most responses have been modest, piecemeal, and reactive, and therefore thoroughly inadequate. Instead of this \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach, cities should adopt a paradigm shift, which involves integrated strategies for promoting resilient, inclusive, competitive, and environmentally sustainable urban supply chain and market infrastructure. In major urban areas, current practices in transport planning focuses on transport infrastructure, such as the city\u2019s road network, bridges, urban railways, and public transport systems, omitting consideration for urban logistics. This needs to change. The range of logistics facilities\u2014such as inland container depots, cargo handling facilities at critical interurban connection points 126 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared Prosperity(railway stations, domestic airports, and ports, for example), urban distribution centers, and small warehousing in urban areas\u2014should be included in the formal transport planning process, to ensure efficient movement of goods for businesses and consumers alike, without negatively affecting the urban environment and livelihood.

While it is tempting to impose physical regulations such as truck bans in cities, this would naturally compromise some stakeholder interests and likely incur other costs. Therefore, we see a crucial need for cities to embrace urban logistics within their transport planning process, strategically locate and ensure land availability for critical logistical facilities, and build a network of services and regulation systems to meet the complex and evolving needs for the urban mobility of both people and goods.

By examining the relationship between the transport network changes from 2009 to 2017 and the socioeconomic characteristics of all communes, we found that the significant improvements in transport connectivity during the period led to wage and welfare increases across the country. However, communes have experienced a highly uneven magnitude of these benefits, depending on the commune\u2019s economic distance to economic opportunities. When we analyzed the counterfactual of population and welfare gains at the commune level without transport network improvement, we found that transport connectivity has slowed down the concentration of economic activities in the two major cities, Hanoi and HCMC. This suggests that improved connectivity and the resultant increases in wages have allowed communes outside the major cities to retain population and improve welfare. The market access index, a composite indicator of population distribution and travel time (or trade costs, which is assumed to be proportionate) represents a locality\u2019s access to economic opportunities. Calculating the market access index for all communes for the two time points, in 2009 and 2017, we found the market access index improved significantly thanks to the improvements in transport connectivity. Market access index is higher for communes well-connected to major transport corridors, such as expressways and international gateways, and the broader opportunities they can provide.

Some critical transport links located along coastal lines, mountainous areas, or flood-prone terrains are highly vulnerable to various climatic events. Significant upfront investments are therefore justified to strengthen their resilience and reduce their vulnerability; even greater investments are justified under future climate change scenarios, which show the increasing likelihood of extreme events.

Our in-depth analysis combining multiple layers of geospatial information supports this argument: even a modest modal shift from road to waterborne transport, which would be economically beneficial given the lower transport costs of the latter, would reduce risk exposure and improve resilience of the overall transport network. In reality, however, achieving multimodality is a challenging and complex undertaking that requires infrastructure development, a regulatory framework, market incentives, and overcoming inertia. We argue that the most critical barriers to multimodality include the lack of inland waterway transport containerization combined with the lack of well-connected and well-equipped river ports to facilitate transshipment and handling of container-on-barge cargo, along with the underutilized potential for domestic coastal shipping. Vietnam could unleash the further potential for inland waterway transport through containerization. While private sector players such as shippers and LSPs would make the necessary investments in containerization, by creating a conducive environment through an improved waterway infrastructure, the Government would provide a consistent capacity to handle large vessels, thereby supporting safe navigation via a vessel traffic management system, and enhancing hinterland connectivity of river ports in key locations. Specifically, the municipal or provincial government could play a more active role in port development through adoption of a landlord port model, leading to joint development agreements between private port operators and provincial or city governments. These subnational governments have a legal responsibility to purse national goals in IWT development and would acquire a strong interest in the flow-through economic benefits successful port activity could bring. Under such a model, the public sector (local governments) would fund, fully or partly, investments in the port substructure (such as approach channels, quay walls, and berth depth) and road connectivity to main highways and make land available for expansion."

Following this approach, the analysis consists of four integral steps as summarized in figure A.1. Hierarchical structure of a value chain is defined on input\u2013output linkages and spatial industrial concentration of all segments. Selecting key value chains The first step is to analytically identify key value chains for this study where Vietnam is already competitive. Four sets of criteria for identifying key value chains include: (a) high trade performance and high importance in the economy; (b) high comparative advantage; (c) high value added and potential for job creation; and (d) in line with the Government\u2019s priority. Identifying value chain linkages The purpose of the second step is to determine the production structure of domestic value chains comprising the identified key value chains by analyzing domestic input\u2013output linkages. The value chain linkages are identified following four key steps: (a) determine first tier supplying sectors (sectors\u2019 backward linkages) using data from Vietnam\u2019s input\u2013output tables for 2011 and 2016; (b) repeat the exercise in the first step multiple times to compute second-, third- or higher tier supplying sectors; (c) create diagrams of value chain linkages; and (d) refine linkages and diagrams based on expert views and sectoral data. The first step, determining first-tier supplying sectors, is based on a sector\u2019s"

This allows us to create value-chain specific concordance tables that link the sectors of the input\u2013output tables to the Vietnam Standard Industrial Classification (VSIC) codes. Note that these concordance tables are value chain specific, as the input\u2013output tables are much more aggregated than the 5-digit VSIC codes (138 sectors vs. 734 sectors), that is, an I/O sector can be linked to different VSIC codes. VSIC is crucial to ensure accurate reference of value chain structure and reliable source of analytical data. Defining spatial structure of value chains The third step is to use the analytical results of the above analysis on input\u2013output linkages of the domestic value chains to determine their spatial structure. In other words, the main purpose of this step is to determine geographical distribution and industrial concentration of selected chains, including the backward segments of the value chain. Spatial structure of value chains is defined as the concentration of employment in each segment of a given value chain.

The information on trade gateways and border gates in all transport forms are important for value-chain based connectivity.

This will simulate the freight flows in accordance with origin\u2013destination model along the spatial organization of value chains and connects chains to main international gateways. The mapping results allowed to identify trade corridors organized to promote value chain linkages, and to evaluate supporting logistics services to improve overall efficiency as well as the competitiveness of selected value chains.

The farm household model maximizes utility from household total consumption and leisure of the members, given the individual and household characteristics under budget and time constraints. The model takes the following form: Max U(Ch, Li; Ai, Bh ) i = head, spouse, eldest child s.t. Qh = f(Tif, Hh; Ai, Fh) Ch + RHh \u2264 PQh + \u2211Wia Tia + \u2211Wina Tina + Zh Wina = Wina (Ai, Mna) Wia = Wia (Ai, Ma) Ti = Tif + Tia + Tina + Li Li>0 Tif, Tia, Tina\u22650 (1) where U is the utility function for household h; Ch is the total household consumption; Li is leisure time for family member i, where i can be head, spouse, and the eldest child;1 Ai is a vector of individual attributes; Bh is a vector of household attributes; Q is the quantity of farm output, determined by a production function f with family labor input Tif, hired inputs Hh, subject to individual attributes (Ai) and"

Wage rates are a function of individual attributes and local labor market conditions in the non- agricultural sector, denoted by Mna, and in the agricultural sector, denoted by Ma. The time constraint is such that the sum of family labor input, wage employment in the agricultural sector and non-agricultural sector, and leisure is equal to the total time available, denoted by Ti; nonnegativity constraints are 137 Appendix Aimposed to allow for nonparticipation in the labor markets.

As a result, reservation wages for each labor activity are inter-related. For example, the reservation wage for non-agricultural labor supply is evaluated at zero non-agricultural labor activity, which means that all time endowment is devoted to household farm or agricultural wage activities. When the marginal value of farm products or market wages exceed the reservation wages, the individual will participate in the labor activities.

The reservation wages are unobserved, so are the market wages for those unemployed. To arrive at a set of estimable reduced-form labor participation equations, the reservation wages are modeled by a function of the observed individual-level, household-level, local community-level characteristics, and individual random effects in the following equations 4(a) through 4(c): Prob(Yif = 1) = Prob(P\u2202Qh/\u2202Tif - Wi(f*) > 0) = Prob(P\u2202Qh/\u2202Tif - Wi(f*) (Ai, Bh, Fh, Mna, Ma) - \u03b5_i> 0) (4a) Prob(Yia = 1) = Prob(Wia - Wi(a*) > 0) = Prob(Wia (Ai, Ma) - Wi(a*) (Ai, Bh, Fh, Mna, Ma) - \u03b5_i > 0) (4b) Prob(Yina = 1) = Prob(Wina - Wi(na*) > 0) = Prob(Wina (Ai, Mna) - Wi(na*) (Ai, Bh, Fh, Mna, Ma) - \u03b5_i > 0) (4c) where \u03b5i is the individual random effect.

        "text": "the household, we use a multivariate probit model (Benjamin and Kimhi 2006) to jointly estimate the non-agricultural wage employment participation decisions. We found two limitations in this analysis. The first limitation relates to the internal validity of the probit estimates. Given that the purpose of this analysis is to document the correlates of non-agricultural wage employment at various levels, we assume that the individual random effects are uncorrelated with Ai, Bh, Fh, Mna, and Ma. To the extent that this assumption is violated, we have limited internal validity of the estimates. Panel data strategies, such as fixed-effects models, can potentially control for this endogeneity. However, the rotating panels of Vietnam Household Living Standards Surveys (VHLSSs) conducted by the General Statistics Office (GSO) in previous years (2012 and 2014) result in small samples that do not provide enough statistical power to estimate the multivariate probit model. The second limitation concerns the external validity due to sample selection. To estimate the multivariate probit model, we need to select the households that have at least one co-residing, working-age child. However, living arrangement is not random. If the unobserved household-specific variables that determine living arrangement also affect non-agricultural wage employment, then we have restricted external validity to apply the results from this analysis to the rest of rural Vietnamese households. We solve this by estimating a household and spouse model, which covers a broader set of households. The findings are qualitatively similar. To estimate the multivariate probit model, we use a sample of 4,257 rural households with 12,771 individuals from the VHLSS in 2016. This nationally representative survey includes detailed information at the individual, household and commune levels. Within each household, we keep only the household head, the spouse, and the eldest child for the first model, or only the household and spouse for"

Market access and spatial wage differences Most of the empirical analysis of the relationship between market access and the spatial variation in wages estimate the relationship using regional average wages instead of individual wages. In this study, we follow Hering and Poncet (2010) to estimate the relationship between market access and wage variation, controlling for individual characteristics such as education, which is an important determinant of earnings. This is particularly important in the context of Vietnam where lagging regions have a higher share of less educated people when compared to the country\u2019s agglomeration centers. A typical Mincerian earnings regression is estimated with individual hourly wages as the dependent variable. The analysis is done with the VHLSS 2016 data, using observations in both rural and urban areas. The new economic geography literature emphasizes that lower transportation costs faced by firms in locations with higher market access allows these firms to pay higher wages, thus explaining the positive relationship between market access and higher wages. Since market access is linked to agglomeration, others have proposed alternative mechanisms relying on agglomeration economics 139 Appendix Ato explain the observed impact of market access on wages. Dekle and Eaton (1999) for example, point out that greater demand pushes up the price of land in agglomeration centers, inducing firms to raise nominal wages to maintain workers\u2019 purchasing power. Hanson (2003) also distinguishes other mechanisms, such as the presence of non-human factor endowments and increasing returns due to spillovers between firms and/or human externalities. As a result, Combes, Duranton, and Gobillon (2008) emphasize skills sorting in explaining the positive relationship between market access and wages, while Head"

These models incorporate features of the data, such as large numbers of locations with heterogeneous geography, productivity, amenities, and local factors as well as trade and commuting costs. They are also able to include interactions between locations, such as trade in goods and migration. These models can be used to evaluate policies and counterfactual scenarios and to set apart the contribution of transport improvements versus other changes that affect wages and population across locations. The models have three main building blocks: \u2022 Geography. The model allows for spatial granularity at the district level considering the 683 districts of Vietnam. Each district is characterized by its location, land area, livability, economic structure, and firm productivity. Livability captures the quality of life in a district, which is determined by factors such as the quality of education and health services that influence people\u2019s choices on where to live. \u2022 Economic activity.

Workers\u2019 decisions on where to live and where to work depend on rents, wages, and livability across districts. Using population, land, and transport data for 2009 and 1017, district productivities and amenities are calibrated to make counterfactual predictions. The information required to calibrate the model is similar to the one used in the calculation of market access and comes from traditional data sources, such as surveys and from geo-coded information on the transport network. The calibration process relies on observed variables\u2014size of land, employment per sector (second model) or wage (first model), and population density) to induce some key parameters that will encompass the unobserved characteristics of each district. Although productivity and livability scores at the district level are not observed, the model is used to infer these scores based on the observed levels of the size and composition of land, employment per sector, and population density. Productivity scores reflect the potential of firms to produce using labor and land inputs. While workers and land are similar across districts, the capacity of firms to produce differ across locations. Livability scores reflect the potential of a district in terms of amenity and affect the residential choice of workers. Workers tend to move toward districts offering higher real wages and higher amenity levels.

In the counterfactuals, the welfare gains from trade depend on changes in both domestic trade shares and reallocations of population across locations. The model has constant returns to scale, with all districts potentially trading with one other. Some locations experience larger reductions in trade costs than others, and population reallocates to these locations and away from other locations until the price of the immobile factor of production land adjusts. However, some differences remain in real wages across districts. Model used to produce counterfactuals for international connectivity The spatial general equilibrium model for Vietnam assesses the effects of improved internal transport costs on the integration of districts with global markets. The model looks at how reductions in transport costs affect the competitiveness of districts in the production of imports and exports\u2014that is, tradeable goods. The model relies on previous work done for Bangladesh,1 Argentina (Fajgelbaum and Redding 2018) and for the Belt and Road Initiative in Central Asia (Lall and Lebrand 2019). Similar to the previous section, the model has three main building blocks\u2014geography, economic activity, and workers\u2014which are connected by goods prices, land rents, and wages that prevail in each district.

Much of this food is fresh and needs to be transported, processed, stored and distributed in a cold or frozen state and this has led to a continually burgeoning cold chain industry in China, including growth in the number of quality alternative cold storage logistics warehouse property assets in the country. According to the Cold Chain Logistics Committee (CFLP) and the Intelligence Research Group, the cold chain industry sector in China has enjoyed double digit growth. In 2020, the market size reached RMB415 billion, a year-on-year growth of 22.38%. Considering the future growth momentum, China\u2019s cold chain logistics market is expected to further increase to about RMB897 billion by 2025 (Figure 24). The underlying factors which are having an influence on the growth of the cold chain industry sector in China are many, but some of the more important what-to-watch industry elements which we consider in this report include: \u03bf Greater consumer spending power; \u03bf A further emphasis on food safety; \u03bf Continued importance placed on food security; \u03bf More value being added to goods during the time between when they enter and exit the cold chain system, and; \u03bf Even though playing a small role in cold chain services demand, an increasing need to transport, store and distribute medicines.

Consumer spending power On a household basis, we have seen disposable income in China continue to rise. As disposable income has risen, so individual citizens have spent more on better quality food and food with a variety of taste. In the first half year of 2022, the per capita disposable income of households in China was RMB18,463, an increase of 4.7% since a year ago (Figure 25).

By some estimates, up to 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to food loss and waste. According to the United Nations Environment Programme around 50% of food losses happen during the initial stages of the supply chain owing to absence of appropriate refrigeration and cold chain tailbacks. Additionally, often if food production exceeds local cold chain capacity at any given time, food is lost. Once food is harvested, it starts to decay. The decay process and speed of decay are influenced by temperature and humidity. Even minor variations in temperature affect the levels of nutrition and the shelf life of food. Picked bananas, for example, are best preserved in conditions where the temperature falls between 13 to 14 degrees centigrade. Apples on the other hand do well when the storage temperature is between 5 and 7.5 degrees centigrade. Therefore, crucial to food safety are cold chain refrigerated vehicles, cold storage rooms, and ripening chambers. Appropriate freezing, chilling or cooling is indispensable for upholding food safety and quality, and the temperature control must be very precise"

SINGAPORE MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Singapore\u2019s economy expanded by 7.6% year-on-year (\u201cy-o-y\u201d) in 2021, a strong rebound from the 4.1% contraction in 2020. While the services-producing industries grew by 5.6% y-o-y in 2021, overall economic growth was led by the recovery of 13.4% y-o-y in the goods-producing industries. Alongside a robust expansion of 20.1% y-o-y for the construction sector, manufacturing grew significantly by 13.2% y-o-y. Singapore\u2019s economic growth in 2022 is projected to slow as the base effect fades. Nonetheless, private consumption is expected to drive economic growth alongside the easing of domestic safe management measures and border restrictions. Against this backdrop, Singapore\u2019s economy is forecasted to expand by 3.0% to 5.0% in 2022, barring an escalation in Russia-Ukraine conflict and a deterioration of the COVID-19 situation. While the immediate impact on the local economy has been manageable, the longer-term impact of the conflict on Singapore\u2019s economy will depend on how the crisis unfolds.

Compared with 2020 when leasing demand was largely driven by shorter leases to accommodate the surge in stockpiling, demand was more stable in 2021 as more industrialists committed to longer leases amid improving business sentiment. While part of the demand came from lease renewals by existing ecommerce players, some third-party logistics (3PL) companies expanded their warehouse network to support growing demand for domestic and international delivery amid the accelerated adoption of ecommerce. For instance, J&T Express opened a new warehouse at Changi Airfreight Centre to manage their international delivery and a new fulfilment centre at Penjuru to meet the rise in demand for ecommerce fulfilment and warehousing solutions. Demand was also driven by some industrialists which have successfully upscaled and internalised their own distribution and warehousing operations (and subsequently expanded or relocated to a larger facility). Furthermore, the rapid adoption of digital supply chain solutions also propelled demand for modern warehouse developments, with more industrialists relocating from older warehouses to newer or ramp-up warehouse facilities. This contributed to the healthy take-up in the West Planning Region, with larger firms taking up significant space in Tuas due to a lack of ready-built ramp-up facilities in other parts of Singapore. Although occupancy rate for warehouse space inched down to 90.3% in Q1/2022 due to a slight decline in occupier demand in the West Planning Region, it remains within the higher range in the last five years.

In the face of operational constraints amid the pandemic, many businesses intensified their efforts to embrace advanced manufacturing, adopt new technology and upskill their workforce. Some initiatives to address the accelerated structural shifts resulting from COVID-19 include the digitalisation of warehousing operations and automation of production lines to cope with fluctuations in demand. As the pandemic quickened the pace of Industry 4.0. transformation, there is a greater shift of demand from traditional storage warehouses to high-specification warehouses with ramp-up facilities, last mile delivery/urban logistics and temperature-controlled facilities. This is fuelled by manufacturers gearing up for a post-pandemic future where supply chains will have to be increasingly nimble.

For instance, 2 Pioneer Sector 1 (2PS1) is already more than 50% pre-committed with tenants from Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), ecommerce and 3PL industries. Amid the pivot to Industry 4.0, landlords of older developments are likely to take the opportunity to embark on asset enhancement initiatives and redevelopment works to remain relevant. Nonetheless, owing to construction delays, the supply of modern warehouse facilities with quality specifications is expected to remain limited in the near term. Meanwhile, the protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine is expected to hit most of the external-oriented sectors in Singapore. As they are major commodity exporters, the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war has strained global supply chains and led to price increase for essential commodities such as oil, gas and industrial metals, which could potentially affect the manufacturing sector. Coupled with rising labour costs, elevated commodity prices are expected to result to higher business costs, which could curtail manufacturing activities. As a result, industrialists are likely to hold back on their expansion plans in the near term.

As a result of a range of factors, particularly the tight global labor market, rising energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks, there is increasing concern about the potential short-term outlook for inflation. As such, most local bond yield forecasts have been revised and the decompression cycle will likely commence sooner than was originally expected. However, it is currently expected that the softening of bond yields will be relatively limited, and rates will remain relatively low over the long term in comparison to historical benchmarks. In its most recent release (March 2022), the Reserve Bank of Australia noted: Inflation has picked up more quickly than the RBA had expected, but remains lower than in many other countries (headline 3.5%). GDP growth is forecast to be 4.25% in 2022 and trend down slightly to 2.0% in 2023.

Based on data released by the National Australia Bank, online sales accounted for 9.3% of retail activity as of January 2020. Since then, online shopping has become an increasingly important part of the broader retail landscape, accounting for 14.7% of total retail sales in 12 months to February 2022, which is approximately 17.4% higher than the 12 months to February 2021. This growth has had a material impact on industrial & logistics demand in Australia, as retailers and third-party logistics providers have been forced to increase their supply chain investment to improve delivery capacity to residential areas. This has resulted in a significant uptick in gross take-up from the Retail Trade & Transport, Postal and Warehousing sectors \u2013 having accounted for 2.3 million sqm gross take-up nationally in 2021 (10-year average \u2013 1.4 million sqm). Based on current projections, it is expected that the online penetration rate in Australia will reach 20% by 2025, which will continue to underpin significant growth in the industrial occupier take-up from the Retail Trade & Transport, Postal and Warehousing sectors (Figure 2). The trend of re-shaping supply chains across the country has extended beyond the eCommerce boom.

Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2021/2022 | 75 ADVANCING OUR REACH CAPTURING OPPORTUNITIES Performance Supply A total of 255,870 sqm of industrial floorspace was delivered in 2021, 49% below the 10-year average of 498,020 sqm. New development activity was demand-led with approximately 76% of the space having secured pre-commitment prior to completion. The supply pipeline is expected to accelerate substantially in the short term, with 1,123,350 sqm of space currently under construction in the Sydney market as at 1Q22. Of this total, 1,038,840 sqm is due to complete over 2022, 66% of which has been pre-committed to. Of this total, 101,440 sqm has already completed in 1Q22 (Figure 5). Prime Rents Rental growth across the Sydney industrial & logistics sector was strong throughout 2021, increasing by 6.2% for prime grade and 7.3% for secondary grade assets. In 1Q22, rental growth accelerated, with Sydney net face rents now averaging AUD 173 psm p.a. for prime assets (+3.2% q-q) and AUD 159 psm p.a. for secondary assets (+3.5% q-q). There has been consistent strong positive rental growth in the prime Sydney industrial market over the last four years. Rental growth will likely be driven over the medium-long term by strong occupier demand, diminishing land supply and competing uses of assets. Yield Observations The average prime yield midpoint declined 113 bps to a record low 3.68% over 2021, while the secondary midpoint yield declined by 128 bps to 4.19%.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, The PRC reported a real GDP growth of 8.1% year-on-year (\u201cYOY\u201d) in 2021, with real GDP growth slowing from 4.9% YOY in 2021Q3 to 4.0% YOY in 2021Q4. Despite complications from the COVID-19 Omicron variant, real GDP growth in The PRC increased to 4.8% YOY in 2022Q1; however, a significant drop remains when compared to the 18.3% YOY growth in 2021Q1. Amid the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some cities and the emergence of new variants, The PRC has implemented strict epidemic control alongside a series of policies, including monetary loosening and dual-circulation strategies to boost the economy. With increasing vaccination rates, The PRC will continue to recover from the lingering effects of the global pandemic throughout 2022.

LOGISTICS MARKET OVERVIEW Demand Drivers Amid the US-China trade dispute and COVID-19 pandemic, demand for warehouse spaces remained robust due to the growth in disposable income and consumption expenditure as well as the rapid expansion of ecommerce and 3rd party logistics (\u201c3PLs\u201d). Growing Disposable Income and Consumption Expenditure The urban consumption expenditure per capita of The PRC grew at a 5-year compound annual growth rate (\u201cCAGR\u201d) of 5.6% in 2021, which is in line with the upward trend of urban disposable income per capita that grew at a 5-year CAGR of 7.1% in the same period. However, in comparison with the developed economies, the consumption expenditure per capita of The PRC, which is only about one-tenth of that of the US or one-seventh of that of Australia, still has significant room for improvement.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, cities were placed under lockdown and the operation of most physical retail stores were suspended. As a result, consumers had no choice but to shift their consumptions from offline to online. From daily necessities to high-end commodity goods, almost everything could be purchased online, which accelerated the growing trend of online shopping. While physical stores gradually resumed normal operations following the containment of the COVID-19 virus, it is expected that a relatively strong growth in ecommerce would still continue amid increasing emphasis on social distancing.

The fluctuations in policies might create confusion and cause uncertainties in the short term. Growth of the primary drivers of warehouse space in The PRC, ecommerce and 3PLs, accelerated in 2021 because of the stay-at- home economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic. With the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, coupled with The PRC\u2019s strict Zero- COVID policy, the shifts in consumer patterns are expected to remain in the near future, which supports the continued demand for online shopping and the need for warehouses and storage spaces. On the supply side, the Zero-COVID policy has led to sudden factory shutdowns and even lockdowns in certain cities. Such issues have disrupted supply chains in The PRC and have led to growing logistics concerns. Despite this uncertainty and potential disruption to factory operations and logistics, freight forwarder and 3PL companies have explored means of expanding their capacities and global presence.

While average annual supply over the period from 2006 to 2010 was 69,000 sq ft IFA, from 2011 to 2020, average annual supply increased to 469,000 sq ft IFA. 2019 saw no new supply completed. From 2011 to 2019, eight warehouse projects were completed in Kwai Tsing, Yuen Long and Fanling, five of which (China Merchants Logistics Centre, China Resources International Logistics Centre, Goodman Interlink, SF Centre and Mapletree Logistics Hub Tsing Yi in Kwai Tsing) are built to modern warehouse standards. There was no new warehouse supply in either 2020 or 2021 (Figure 4). The confluence of several adverse elements in recent years, emanating from both external and domestic sources, negatively impacted logistics demand and vacancy increased from 3.8% in 2011 to 5.4% in 2020. In particular, the US / China trade tensions, coupled with local social unrest, derailed logistics demand in 2019, leading to a negative take-up of 622,000 sq ft IFA in that year. Nonetheless, the gradual containment of COVID-19 and the subsequent re-alignment of supply chains, as well as the increasing prominence of e-commerce revived the logistics sector in 2020, with 351,000 sq ft IFA of warehouse space taken up over the year. Following the COVID-19 outbreak at the start of 2020, global supply chains were disrupted, presenting increasing challenges to the movement of cargo, thereby affecting the freight forwarding and cross-border distribution functions of logistics operators. This pushed overall warehouse vacancy up to 4.1% in Q4/2020, the highest level since the Global Financial Crisis"

WAREHOUSE RENTAL TRENDS The trading and retail sales segments were impacted by social unrest and the trade war along with the pandemic. This resulted in a weak performance, leading to declining logistics demand and dampening modern warehouse rental growth in both 2019 and 2020. With firmer business prospects in 2021, many logistics operators opted to renew leases in Q3/2021, averaging six to nine months ahead of expiry, to avoid any business disruption. Modern warehouses in both Kwai Tsing and Tsuen Wan, as well as general warehouses in Tuen Mun, recorded a number of renewal cases of long-term tenants. Other logistics operators saw their businesses grow in the buoyant market conditions in 2021 and decided to expand and relocate. Both 3PLs (such as Kerry Logistics and Hi-speed Logistics) and end users (such as Coca-cola and Park\u2019N Shop) have made moves over the past few months to expand and consolidate into new warehouse locations to suit their business expansion needs. In Q1/2022, external uncertainties, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the re-emergence of COVID cases in China, disrupted both global and regional supply chains. Nevertheless, the immediate impact of the former on the local logistics sector has been minimal so far. The Mainland outbreak, however, had a much more profound impact on the supply of daily necessities, and the affected areas were mostly land transport to supermarkets and wet markets.

Government-related logistics demand was surprisingly active over the quarter with a few large warehouse floor plates reportedly leased to various government departments in Chai Wan and Tuen Mun. The escalating COVID-19 situation locally has induced logistics demand for medical equipment, virus-prevention materials as well as testing / protective items sourced from different countries to be distributed locally in a timely manner. At the end of Q1/2022, average modern warehouse rents stood at HK$14.1 per sq ft gross, an 8.6% y-o-y increment and a 4.8% downward adjustment from Q2/2019. General warehouses, which are mainly owned by local individual landlords / industrialists, were slower in terms of marking their asking rents to market. At the end of Q1/2022, average overall warehouse rents stood at HK$11.6 per sq ft gross, a 6.5% y-o-y rebound and a 5.1% decline from Q2/2019 (Figure 6).

This supply comprises one project in Tuen Mun, one mega project on the Airport Island, and one logistics site tendered by the Government in Kwai Chung (Table 2). While local logistics demand remains intact in the short-term, the continuation of the Russia- Ukraine war, as well as the re-emergence of COVID-19 infections in Mainland China will continue to cause global and regional supply chain disruption, which may have an adverse effect on the local logistics scene from Q2 onwards.

As such, we expect warehouse rents to remain stable over the remainder of 2022. Modern warehouses are expected to move in a similar direction over the same period. Areas benefiting from newly completed infrastructure, such as Liantang / Heung Yuen Wai Border Control Point in the North-eastern New Territories, as well as Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link linking up Tuen Mun South and Hong Kong International Airport, should also see improving demand prospects. Another recent trend boosting the demand for short-term warehouses is the increasing demand for cold storage. With COVID-19 resulting in social distancing measures, there has been an increasing need for chilled meat and frozen food from households. In 2021, there was greater relocation and expansion of cold store operators, such as 100 Storage Cold-Chain Logistics Services relocating and leasing two units on 6/F (around 120,000 sq ft) of Hutchison Logistics Centre in Kwai Chung. We also saw others renewing their leases to avoid business disruption, such as Beidahuang Logistics Limited in their cold store in Seapower Industrial Centre in Kwun Tong. With a typical cold store demanding very high building specifications (4-5m clear ceiling height and 17.5 kPa floor loading), warehouses possessing such specifications should be in demand over the next two to three years.

On the other hand, the pandemic has spurred the development of many industries due to accelerated shifts in technology, consumer behavior, supply- chains, geo-politics, climate change and a host of other factors. India has shown a \u201cV\u201d shape recovery in various economic estimates. Advance estimates indicate that India has recovered past the pre-pandemic levels witnessing real GDP expansion of 8.9 per cent in 2021-22 after contracting 8 per cent in 2020-21. India\u2019s agriculture and allied sector was the least impacted by the pandemic and the sector is expected to grow by 3.9% in 2021-22 as compared to 3.6% in the previous year. Gross value added for the industry will rise by 11.8% in 2021-22 as compared to -7% in 2020-21. The Services sector, the most affected sector by the pandemic, is estimated to grow by 8.2% in the current year following last year\u2019s -8.4% contraction. Investment, as measured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is expected to see strong growth of 15% in 2021-22 and achieve full recovery of pre-pandemic levels. Government policies through capex and infrastructure spending has increased capital formation in the economy, raising the ratio of investment to GDP to about 29.6% in 2021-22. India\u2019s net exports were negative in the first half of 2021-22 compared to the surplus in the corresponding period of 2020-21.

Expansionary monetary policies by developed economies are also pushing external demand for India\u2019s exports. Exports are expected to grow by 16.5% in 2021-22. Imports have also recovered strongly with domestic demand and rising prices of imported crude and metals. Imports are expected to grow by 29.4% in 2021-22. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation moderated to 5.2% in 2021-22 (April- December) from 6.6% in the corresponding period of 2020-21. Wholesale Price Inflation (WPI), however, has been hitting double- digits at 13%. The inflation in the \u2018fuel and power\u2019 group of WPI was above 20% reflecting higher international petroleum prices.

These spaces are expected to cater to the increasing demand from consumer-driven sectors such as E-Commerce, 3PL, FMCG, Retail, etc. as well as some manufacturing sectors such as Auto & Ancillaries, Engineering, Electronics & White Goods, etc. Among the eight major cities, more than half of the warehousing stock is contributed by the three largest cities of the country including Delhi NCR, Mumbai and Bengaluru. The country\u2019s warehousing market witnessed new supply of 9 mn sq.ft. in Q1 2022 and is expected to witness an additional 35.6 mn sq.ft. of supply by the end of 2022. This supply is majorly provided by institutional developers/ investors such as Indospace, ESR, Blackstone, Ascendas, LOGOS as well as regional developers such as NDR, Global Group, Mussadilal, etc. The stock is further projected to reach 361 mn sq.ft. by 2023 and the new supply is expected to be rapidly absorbed on the back of existing strong demand (Figure 1).

The future outlook for the growth of the warehousing demand is positive in India with net absorption projected to cross the 40 mn sq.ft. mark by 2025. A strong net absorption as well as gradual reduction in overall vacancy are expected in the upcoming years (Figure 2).

Pune is another city whose warehousing market showed strong resilience amid COVID-19 and recovered in the year 2021 and in Q1 2022. The two key drivers for the warehousing demand in the city include manufacturing and consumption. The city provides a thriving manufacturing ecosystem in regions such as Chakan, Talegaon and Nagar Road. The warehousing rents in the city are highest among all due to the high land prices. Despite high rentals in warehousing sub-markets of Chakan-Talegaon and Nagar Road, the demand from e-commerce players are increasing due to the presence of good quality Grade A spaces and strong connectivity.

Growing E-Commerce Industry in India The e-commerce sector, along with the 3PL sector, has emerged as the main driver of the Indian warehousing market. The share of the e-commerce sector in transactions has increased from 15% in 2017 to 26% in 2021. Many e-commerce companies are expected to grow as people adopt a behavioral shift from buying offline to online. The pandemic has accelerated e-commerce adoption rates, leading to an increase in the demand for online delivery of essential and non-essential items. The growth in e-commerce has turned warehouse and distribution centers into mega fulfillment centers, translating to demand for larger space requirement as haves been witnessed in India recently.

Spurting Demand for In-City/ Urban Logistics Urban logistics in India enjoyed a strong pick-up in demand post-pandemic as consumers move to online channels for purchases. As a result, the Indian market has seen a surge in key players including global e-commerce companies such as Blinkit, Chaayos, Suppr Daily, etc. to increase penetration into warehouses in the city in order to increase the efficiency of same-day delivery services. India is expected to witness an additional ~7 mn sq.ft. of in-city warehouse space demand by 2022 spread across tier 1 and tier 2 cities. With the advent of changing consumer behavior and technology adoption, urban logistics spaces can be a game-changer in catering to the rising demand in cities for faster order fulfilment rates. Demand for urban logistics space is likely to be a growing and sustainable trend. Demand from 3PL Logistics Players With the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017, corporate strategies for warehousing and distribution strategies have changed. Decisions on warehouse locations and specifications are now based on supply chain efficiency considerations rather than tax-saving benefits. Consequently, there has been a shift towards the integration of small warehouses into large fulfillment centers. Logistics companies have seized this opportunity and switched from a model of managing single company warehouses to a multi-client and multi-product model. The small e-commerce players take advantage of these multi-client and multi-product facilities as they need flexibility in terms of seasonal space requirements. The companies can also benefit with cutting"

While the growth rate exceeded 10% in the initial half year of 2021, the rate has been slowing down slightly in the second half of the year. This is a result of the normalisation of economic activities due to the easing of COVID-19 measures and shifting consumer behaviours. However, with continued slump in consumer spending from self-isolation due to the new Omicron variant spread in 2022 and price hikes of resources due to the Russian-Ukraine war, real GDP is expected to be lower in 2022 as compared to 2021.

On the other hand, the pre-commitment rate for the following year\u2019s supply as at the end of 2021 was 57%, in contrast to 42% this year, raising concerns about a shortage of demand for the supply of 6,000,000 m2 in 2022. In all four main metropolitan areas, vacancy rates are increasing, except in the Nagoya area, where vacancy rates were somewhat high, shortage of vacant space in the large-scale logistics facilities in 2021, and actual rental rates were on uptrend. Reasons behind high demand Demand is driven by advance leasing from e-commerce-related companies and an expansion of leases due to the consolidation of sites and the replacement of obsolete buildings by manufacturer shippers, in addition to continued leasing demand from 3PL providers. E-commerce is the most significant demand driver, with e-commerce-related demand expected to account for about a little less than 30% of total demand in 2020 through 2022, up from around 10% till 2019.

As of October 2021, the expected cap rate multi-tenant facilities in the Greater Tokyo and Osaka areas was 4.2% and 4.6% on respectively. Cap rates remained steady for some time, but started to fall due to the rise in demand for logistics real estate caused by the COVID-19 crisis (Figure 4). In many cases, cap rate has fallen to the 3% range on an NOI basis on actual sales. In addition, it is not only the developed properties but also existing income- generating properties which continue to be increasingly highly appraised and are transacted at low cap rates. Demand for Large-scale Logistics Facilities The need for large-scale rental logistics facilities remains strong. Large-scale, modern- spec facilities are highly sought after as they support efficient operations and also provide generous amenities. This suggests ample scope for upward movement in the market development rate.

Given this situation, supply is likely to continue to be high at approximately 6,000,000 m2 for some time. Outlook for Demand Nationwide demand has increased from 4,200,000 in 2018 to 4,400,000 m2 in 2021, which was below the supply of 5,000,000 m2 in 2021.

The scale of demand in the Nagoya area is about 1/7 that of demand in the Greater Tokyo area, so vacancy rate tends to rise if several multi- tenant facilities are developed at the same time. Against this background, a large volume of supply is scheduled for 2022 and 2023 in the Nagoya area. So far, approximately 450,000 tsubo of logistics real estate has been developed and supplied in the Nagoya area, but 500,000 tsubo of new supply is scheduled for the future. There are concerns that the supply-demand balance may deteriorate as a result of this large volume of supply in 2022 and beyond. Other areas Sendai Metropolitan area The scale of demand in the Sendai metropolitan area is relatively small, at about 1/20 of that in the Greater Tokyo area.

There are numerous Built- to-suit (BTS) developments in this area, but multi-tenant facilities are also being developed, in areas such as the Iwanuma and Izumi districts. Although reconstruction demand is not as vigorous as it was previously, the supply of space is limited, so rent levels are gradually rising.

Performance INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH Japan Hiroshima Metropolitan area The majority of warehouses in the Hiroshima metropolitan area are single user or owner occupied properties, although newly completed multi-tenant facilities in Itsukaichi and Nishi-ku have commenced operations recently. New multi-tenant facilities were also recently added to the Seifushinto and Shiwa districts. Demand for logistics space around Nishi-ku (adjacent to Shoko Center) is particularly high, resulting in comparatively high rents (about JPY 4,000 per tsubo) due to limited space available. However, for other locations in Hiroshima, the prolonged COVID-19 had negatively impacted demand for warehouse, reducing the number of prospective tenants and space required as compared to pre-pandemic times.

The spike in positive coronavirus cases since September 2020 (the third wave of infections) led to the re-imposition of various phases of movement control order - MCO 2.0 in January 2021, followed by MCO 3.0 and full lockdown (FMCO) in May 2021. The economy slipped back into contraction with GDP shrinking 4.5% in 3Q2021 (2Q2021: +16.1%), weighed down by the strict containment measures. However, the progressive lifting of containment measures and normalisation of domestic activities supported by high vaccination rates saw the economy rebounding 3.6% in 4Q2021. For the full year of 2021, Malaysia\u2019s economy expanded 3.1%, supported by improvement in market conditions with continued policy support (Figure 1).

The continuation of large-scale infrastructure projects such as the under-construction East Coast Rail Line (ECRL), Mass Rapid Transit Sungai Buloh-Serdang-Putrajaya Line (MRT2), Light Rail Transit Bandar Utama\u2013Klang Line (LRT3), and Pan Borneo Highway will provide additional lift to the nation\u2019s economic growth. As for headline inflation, it increased to 3.2% in 4Q2021 (3Q2021: 2.2%), mainly due to the lapse in the three-month electricity bill discounts, which was implemented in July 2021. For 2021, the overall headline inflation averaged at 2.5% due to the cost-push factor of higher global oil prices. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) expects headline inflation to remain moderate in 2022 as the base effect from fuel inflation dissipates.

The recovery was mainly driven by improved domestic private consumption and trade, supported by the Government\u2019s new initiative of living with the virus. In response to the pandemic and its subsequent economic impact, the Government rolled out several expansionary policies. These included a two-phased handout of a total of KRW10 trillion subsidies for small to medium businesses, a corporate tax discount, COVID-19 relief funds and introduction of the Human New Deal policies in the Korean New Deal 2.0 update, which mainly focused on lowering unemployment rates. Under the policy, South Korea\u2019s unemployment rate was reduced from 5.0% in Q1 2021 to 2.9% in Q4 2021, reaching its lowest level since Q3 2013. On 26 August 2021, the Bank of Korea (BOK) raised interest rates by 25 basis points, from 0.50% to 0.75%, being the first major Asian country to raise interest rates since the COVID-19 outbreak.

Korea Capital Market Institute forecasts that the BOK may further increase interest rates to 1.75% in 2022, subject to inflation rate movements. Nonetheless, the International Monetary Fund and BOK confidently forecast in January 2022 that the economy would be less affected by the interest rate hikes and is expected to grow further, by 3.0% y-o-y in 2022, driven by domestic consumption and trade.

The giant offline retail player E-mart liquidated its assets when it acquired E-bay Korea in June 2021. Also, emerging giants in fresh food and early morning delivery services such as Market Kurly, Oasis, and SGG.COM are expected to go public in the second half of 2022, gaining higher liquidity to expand capacity. This intense demand for Grade A logistics facilities is expected to continue in 2022. As operators of fresh food and meal kit services often require dry and cold storage spaces, the leasing trend has shifted towards sizable hybrid centres. E-commerce players are advancing their same-day or next-day services by including overnight-delivery schedules, thus seeking leasing opportunities within large-scale logistics facilities with automation processes near major cities to handle high delivery volumes. Existing Stock and Future Pipeline in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) According to the Building Registry of Korea and Colliers\u2019 research, about 2.9 million sq. m. in logistics warehousing was added to the SMA during 2021. Most of this new stock was in the Southeast and Northwest submarket with 1.7 million sq. m. and 0.8 million sq. m, respectively. As at the end of 2021, logistics centres in the SMA provided about 24.2 million sq. m. gross floor area, with the traditional logistics hub of Southeast submarket accounting for about 39.7% of it (Figure 1). 102 | Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2021/2022 ADVANCING OUR REACH CAPTURING OPPORTUNITIES Performance INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH South Korea Source: Colliers Table 1: New Supply in the 2022"

The Northwest Submarket, driven mainly by Incheon\u2019s demand, has been attracting developers due to its capability to host mega-scale logistic centres and its accessibility. Multiple mega-scale logistic centres will be developed in the next two years, bringing about 3.3 million sq. m. fresh supply to the area. Most large-scale logistic centres are expected to be developed in Siheung and Pyeongtaek from 2024 onwards (Table 1). SMA Logistics Market Leasing Performance Despite the recent surge in supply, the average vacancy rate in logistics assets in the SMA remained tight at 3.3% as of Q4 2021, on the back of significant demand for new and modern logistics centres. Pre- leasing agreements have been occurring across multiple recent Grade A logistics centre developments, due to an increasing number of developers adopting built-to- suit strategies. Most new centres, especially those with a superior location, accessibility, and modern facilities, could secure 100% commitment during pre-leasing or contain the absorption period within a quarter upon completion.

Transactions in 2020 were worth a record- breaking KRW2.6 trillion, which more than doubled to around KRW5.3 trillion over 2021. The phenomenal growth during the pandemic has made the logistics sector the most desirable and secure income product amongst all other real estate asset classes. Competition for quality logistics centres has heated up among domestic and international investors, and the cap rates for SMA logistics centres have compressed significantly over the past three years. For instance, GS Networks Dohwa logistics centre and Samdeok TLS logistics centre transacted at a 3.8% and 3.7% cap rate respectively in 2021. As of 2021, the spread between the SMA logistics and Seoul general office cap rate has narrowed to only 40 basis points. Due to significant cap rate compression and rising confidence in the logistics sector, an increasing number of experienced investors are willing to take development risks, entering the market during the planning and development stage, or through forward purchase before completion to maximise investment return. For instance, in Q4 2021, AEW acquired two Grade A logistics properties in Yeoju and Incheon, estimated to be completed in 2022 and 2023, respectively, at KRW633 billion. Hana Alternative Investment purchased Anseong Ga-ri logistics centre, scheduled for completion in April 2022 at KRW60 billion. Major international funds, including Hines, Nuveen, Goldman Sachs, and Brookfield, have also invested in the development stage. Nonetheless, owing to the expected interest hike in 2022, we expect the average cap rate for SMA logistics facilities to rise moderately in the short term. However, modern logistics assets in favourable locations are likely to continue enjoying cap rate compression along with the fast-maturing market (Figure 5).

However, increasing vaccination rates have allowed many businesses to reopen and reduced the amount of border restrictions. Import and export turnover of goods still had a fair growth outlook with a value of 668.5 billion USD. FDI capital in 2021 also increased by 9.2% year-on-year (\u201cy-o-y\u201d) to USD 31.15 billion, according to Vietnam\u2019s General Statistics Office. With the country\u2019s stable macro-economic conditions, improving business environment, developing infrastructure, sustained foreign investment as well as growing manufacturing and export sectors, Vietnam is expected to make a gradual recovery after the pandemic.

These trends have underscored Vietnam\u2019s attractiveness to foreign investors, due to its competitive advantage in areas such as favorable demographics, enhanced economic integration, preferential incentives from supportive government policies, an improving business environment and legal framework as well as rapid infrastructure improvements. Demand for logistics & warehousing space is on the rise due to FDI and manufacturing activities increasing steadily over the years, along with the increase in domestic economic growth and consumption. Similarly, Vietnam market also witnessed growth in retail & e-commerce sectors which has increased demand for logistics and warehousing space. In particular, B2C e-commerce revenue recorded an average growth of 24% p.a. in 2016 \u2013 2020 and is expected to maintain that growth rate in the following period (2021 \u2013 2025), while total retail sales of consumer goods and services also increased by 9.4% p.a. on average during the same period.

The relatively low supply of available warehouse space presents an opportunity for logistics developments with higher yields and rental rates, thereby attracting more investments to the north. This report describes the respective warehouse markets in Bac Ninh and Binh Duong. BAC NINH WAREHOUSE MARKET OVERVIEW Economic Overview Bac Ninh\u2019s economy expanded rapidly during 2015 \u2013 2018 driven by investments from large manufacturing companies. However, it experienced a considerable decline in gross regional domestic product (\u201cGRDP\u201d) growth in 2019 to only 1.1% due to a decrease in phone and accessories production, particularly from Samsung Electronics and Samsung Display. In 2021, despite the heavy impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the province posted significant growth of 6.9%, with the industrial sector showing positive signs as the Index of Industrial Production (\u201cIIP\u201d) expanded 9.7% (Figure 1). Despite sluggish growth in 2019-2020, Bac Ninh remains one of the largest industrial hubs of Vietnam and among the leading investment destinations in the North. Due to sustained inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), development of domestic enterprises, improvement of business environment as well as rising labor productivity, the outlook for the provincial economy is expected to remain positive. FDI is considered the main driver of economic development in Bac Ninh. A favorable geographical position, abundant labor force, good infrastructure for production and support from government policies have made the province an attractive investment destination for foreign investors. 106 | Mapletree Logistics Trust Annual Report 2021/2022 ADVANCING OUR REACH CAPTURING OPPORTUNITIES Performance INDEPENDENT MARKET RESEARCH Source: Bac Ninh Statistics Office Figure 1: Bac Ninh GRDP, GRDP Growth and IIP Growth by Year 2015"

Despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic in 2021, the province attracted total registered capital of US$2.1 billion with 75 newly FDI projects, down 44% in terms of new projects but up 13% in terms of total registered capital. The province continued to be among the top 5 destinations in attracting foreign investments. As of 2021, the province ranked 4th nationwide with 4,021 effective projects with a total investment capital of US$37.2 billion, second only to HCMC. (Figure 6 and 7). Furthermore, the province is transforming its economy by focusing more on service industries, high tech production, and sustainable urbanization to capitalise on the Industrial Revolution 4.0 wave. This will boost global economic cooperation and attract more investments into the province. In 2021, Binh Duong ranked 6th nationwide on the Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI) with a score of 69.61/100 and ranked 1st in the Southeast Region. The province was scored high in terms of time costs, proactivity and business support services. Warehouse Market As of 2021, total warehouse supply of Binh Duong reached over 2 million sq.m, increasing 12% y-o-y and registering average growth of 8% p.a from 2018-2022 (Figure 8). Binh Duong\u2019s total stock was more than double that of Dong Nai and nearly threefold that of Long An, being the most active and developed logistics center in the South. A project named Frasers My Phuoc 3 in Ben Cat Town became active in Q4 2021, adding over 42.000 sq.m to the market.

This is even more apparent in Southeast Asia, where both pandemic-related disruptions and more recent inflationary pressures appeared in a time of increasing growth and digitalization in the industry\u2014 accelerating some preexisting trends and putting pressure on profits for retailers that are already investing in growth. While some themes shaping the sector\u2014such as the growth of e-commerce\u2014have continued throughout this period, additional headwinds are once again testing the resilience of grocers and the food industry as a whole. Executives have expressed some uncertainty about market conditions in 2022, pointing to lower profit margins, heightened competition, a difficult profitability equation in omnichannel, and rising inflation looming.

Moving further into 2022 and beyond, grocers will face growing pressure on margins and pricing as they navigate the need to cater to broader consumer tastes and demands as well as clear signs of bifurcations in consumer spending behaviors (in other words, continued premiumization but also large consumer segments trading down and prioritizing value-for-money). Omnichannel complexity will continue to rise, with consumers seeking more seamless experiences and manageable fulfillment fees. We recognize the industry faces significant uncertainty. All grocery executives are grappling with a series of questions: As consumer behavior continues to evolve, how can grocers best cater to new trends such as health and wellness and value? E-commerce has become table stakes, but how can grocers continue to enhance the omnichannel experience while improving profitability? How much will they need to invest in automation, and how can they harness technology to change the operating model for stores and employees? As sustainability gains traction, what is the right way to begin the journey or build on existing plans? This report\u2014the first edition for Southeast Asia\u2014aims to answer those questions. Its contents are part of McKinsey\u2019s broader global series, The state of grocery retail, an annual publication covering the developments of the grocery retail industry in three regions (Asia\u2013Pacific, the European Union, and North America). Our goal is to frame major trends and issues for CEOs seeking to stay ahead of market shifts. To offer a holistic view of industry dynamics, the report complements insights and analyses from our colleagues with surveys and interviews with grocery executives. We hope the report will offer new insights that can help grocers, and those in the broader food industry, remain competitive during these unprecedented times.

Modern grocery retailers must be prepared to adapt their strategy to achieve sustainable value creation and compete with fragmented trade, which itself is being reshaped by emerging eB2B platforms. We explore six trends that will influence modern grocery retail in ASEAN in the coming years: 1. Increasingly discerning consumers The pandemic-fueled rise in grocery retail spending will likely persist even after the pandemic abates. Contributing factors include the transition to hybrid- and remote-work arrangements and the increase in dining at home. McKinsey research has identified three distinct priorities influencing consumer purchasing decisions (see sidebar, \u201cAbout the research\u201d). Amid a period of economic volatility, consumers are tightening their belts and actively looking for ways to stretch their resources (\u201cbetter value for me\u201d). In parallel, they are working to improve their physical wellness and immunity (\u201chealthier for me\u201d) through healthy eating, better nutrition, and an increased focus on macro- and micronutrients. A third well- documented pattern is a willingness to purchase food online. (For more, see \u201cThe changing face of consumer demand.\u201d) About the research We conducted surveys of 1,003 people in Indonesia and 1,020 people in Vietnam to inform this report. These surveys asked respondents about their shopping habits and expectations, and our analysis focused specifically on modern-trade shoppers. We carried out similar approaches and methodologies in Australia, China, India, and South Korea to round out our research on the region. In addition, we drew on the McKinsey Indonesia Consumer Pulse Survey, which included about 1,000 respondents and was conducted periodically from March 2020 until August 2021. The survey explored consumers\u2019 thoughts about their overall economic prospects. We augmented these surveys with case studies assessing company financials from our client work (when publicly available), interviews with retail executives in each of the ASEAN markets to understand their strategy and profitability,"

Fierce competition from ecosystem players Most grocery retailers are well acquainted with increased competition from traditional players. Potentially more threatening is the rise of ecosystems and digital players with value propositions that could erode the competitive advantages of physical retailers. For example, mobility and e-commerce aggregators tend to use grocery categories to drive traffic to their own platforms. Retailers face a vexing dilemma. By ceding core consumer interaction points to these players, they could gain a revenue"

However, a lack of collaboration could also lead some aggregators and platforms to monetize this access (for example, with retail media networks5) before retailers do. 5 Marc Brodherson, Jon Flugstad, Quentin George, and Jack Trotter, \u201cBusted! Five myths about retail media,\u201d McKinsey, June 7, 2022. 10 Navigating market headwinds \u2013 The state of grocery retail 2022: Southeast Asia 3. A shift from growth to profitability In many ASEAN countries, modern retail has achieved rapid growth before becoming profitable. While retailers have made remarkable headway toward profitable growth, breaking even remains a challenge, especially in online grocery, and will require new business models. Modern grocery is expected to become prevalent in core urban areas in ASEAN over the next decade. This saturation will lead retailers to explore two new sources of growth. First, they will innovate and reorient their prepandemic customer value proposition to keep pace with new preferences. Second, they will increasingly seek to find sources of profitability, such as maintaining gross margins through negotiations, rationalizing store networks thoughtfully, or embarking on broader cost reduction initiatives. (For more, see \u201cASEAN grocery: Balancing growth with profitability.\u201d) 4. Fresh offerings under pressure from digital players Larger-format modern retailers have distinguished themselves with fresh offerings (fruits, vegetables, meat, and seafood) that are competitive on not only price but also quality and assortment. To balance quality, price, and profitability in fresh offerings, modern retailers must overcome several challenges, including securing stable, high-quality sources and maintaining consistent quality across outlets and through different seasons. Competition is increasing: fresh produce can be purchased through e-commerce or more specialized small-scale niche supermarkets. These channels are particularly popular in countries with more"

Competing demands on omnichannel According to our ASEAN consumer survey, e-commerce penetration in grocery, while still low, continues to grow rapidly as consumers prioritize convenience, safety, and promotions. Although consumers are embracing omnichannel, the economics remain challenging for retailers. On the one hand, the main goals for start-ups are increasing gross merchandise value and boosting user acquisition and retention. On the other hand, consumers are demanding more, and they still believe delivery charges are too expensive. As observed in other geographies, retailers will have to refine their omnichannel positioning to strike a balance between rising consumer expectations and difficult unit economics. Options include online offers, click and collect, and partnerships with digital players. (For more, see \u201cCrafting an omnichannel value proposition in the wake of the e-grocery revolution.\u201d) 6. A growing emphasis on sustainability Consumers, investors, regulators, and nongovernmental organizations are pressuring companies in the food system to take tangible steps toward sustainability. Asian consumers are expressing concerns about climate change and show an increased willingness to shift their spending habits accordingly, so grocers must develop strategic sustainability transition plans. ASEAN has much catching up to do on issues such as plastic packaging, the race to net-zero emissions, and social equity. And customers, employees, and investors will increasingly hold retailers accountable for their environmental footprints. 11 Navigating market headwinds \u2013 The state of grocery retail 2022: Southeast Asia This challenge is exceptionally complex\u2014 for instance, in the race to net zero, emissions generated from the average retailer\u2019s own operations, together with purchased electricity and heat, are responsible for just 4 percent of the total footprint. Moreover, getting rid of plastics or making more \u201chealthy\u201d recipes requires consumers to"

They can get started on this journey by pursuing five \u201cresets,\u201d which can anchor their transformation over the next decade. Reset 1: Reframe the playing field to embrace consumer tech Media, entertainment, food service, and food retail are increasingly converging into a \u201cconsumer tech\u201d ecosystem, so retailers need to think like disruptors. Retailers can ask themselves the following key questions: \u2022 Who is our customer? \u2022 What is our distinctive value proposition? \u2022 Where are our inefficiencies? \u2022 Where can we disrupt the value chain and create a better, cheaper, more direct line to the customer? \u2022 In which categories do we have a distinctive edge? How are we positioned in fresh? Beyond fresh, where can we offer customers the best assortment? \u2022 How will retailers gain access to proprietary insights, assets, customers, and suppliers? \u2022 Where can retailers partner using a programmatic mergers, acquisitions, and alliances (M&A&A) approach? The answers to these questions can help modern retailers distill their competitive advantages and make the right investments to expand confidently beyond their existing offerings.

Reset 3: Digitalize, digitalize, digitalize Retailers no longer have excuses for not harnessing digital technologies to both elevate their consumer value proposition and improve their own operations. The only way to achieve sustained growth is to get smarter, cheaper, and faster through strategies such as serving the customer 24/7 through an online-to-offline approach, enabling precision marketing through data analytics, or using technology to automate or streamline the value chain. By incorporating data and technology, retailers can double their output and quality at half the cost.

Two themes guiding growth The top-line numbers are impressive: revenue growth among grocery retailers is projected to be 10 to 12 percent annually in Indonesia and Malaysia, with Vietnam and Thailand each growing around 7 percent annually in the next decade.\u00b9 The Philippines and Singapore are expected to grow less rapidly because the penetration of modern store formats in those markets is relatively higher. So what is driving this expansion? Two common themes have emerged across all markets. First, the convergence of formats between traditional and modern trade has resulted in the disproportionate growth of small modern formats. Second, consolidation and localization are prevalent across markets. At this stage, regional (cross-border) expansion has been limited, likely because most strong players have found enough headroom in their own markets. 1. Stronger tailwinds for small modern formats Across the region, convenience stores and neighborhood supermarkets have become more popular, while family grocers are increasingly locating their stores in residential areas, moving away from the earlier growth model that prioritized dense, high-traffic urban centers. Both chains and independently owned outlets have adopted some of the elements of modern trade. Yet revenue growth is not homogeneous across formats. Overall, we expect a more rapid expansion of small modern formats, which more effectively meet consumer needs. ASEAN shoppers have lower rates of car ownership than their counterparts in the United States or Europe, as well as less disposable income for large-basket purchases. For both of these reasons, ASEAN shoppers tend to favor stores near"

Convenience stores tend to cater to urban shoppers and rely heavily on high-traffic locations, on-the-go consumption, ready- to-eat food, and a small selection of packaged food and drinks (with more limited fresh-food offerings). In Malaysia, for instance, convenience stores have evolved into three competing concepts: lifestyle retailers, such as FamilyMart and KK Super Mart; minimarts, such as 99 Speedmart; and stores linked to gas stations, such as Shell Select.

In Indonesia and Vietnam, for instance, industry experts expect small semi-urban minimart formats to be closer to profitability than pure convenience stores. Interestingly, the industry is starting to see a convergence between traditional and modern retail in which some mom- and-pop stores grow into large family grocers to complement market stalls and other niche outlets. These stores feature a broader product assortment, fixed prices, and a shopping experience closer to that of modern retail, in which people enter the store to shop. Family grocers in rural and suburban areas have the same appeal as a minimart, featuring an acceptable assortment, cashiers, shelves organized by product category, shopping assistance, and transparent pricing. They are also well supported by consumer goods manufacturers and their distributors, receiving a fair share of trade spending, access to consumer promotions, and regular visits by merchandisers. Corporate retail players have spotted this opportunity and are developing business models to help modernize traditional trade by extending their loyalty programs and distribution networks to family grocers.

First, the regulatory environment may have encouraged foreign players to focus their investments on larger stores. For example, Vietnam requires investors to apply for an \u201ceconomic needs test\u201d for each individual store opened, while Indonesia and Malaysia have explicit constraints on the ownership of smaller stores. Second, local players have been consistently better at directly addressing local shopper needs, reinventing formats, and rapidly tailoring their assortments. Finally, local insights and on-the-ground decision making have been critical, allowing retailers to identify and capture the best locations. These capabilities are even more important as some local retailers begin to own parallel business units that develop commercial real estate. Going forward, these national champions may look for cross-border growth opportunities. Some Southeast Asian retailers\u2014such as Central in Vietnam and Alfamart in the Philippines\u2014have already invested across markets. However, companies are likely to continue relying on local strategic partners and acquisitions to enable true cross-country growth. For example, Central in Vietnam partnered with local retailer Lan Chi Mart to expand its footprint in smaller cities, while Alfamart joined forces with SM in the Philippines. Meanwhile, as core players experience some degree of consolidation, the expectations of the growing local middle class are evolving, leading to more polarization (for example, rising demand for premium fresh products on one end of the spectrum and demand for economically competitive offerings on the other). Paradoxically, this consolidation also leads to more niche opportunities and a fragmentation of the value propositions in the long tail,2 with"

We have identified six fundamental trends and disruptions that could help reshape the industry across Southeast Asia (Exhibit 2): 1. The rise of small formats. The rise of small formats has consistently fueled growth in local markets, especially in Indonesia and Vietnam. This redistribution of the revenue pool can attract new entrants seeking to capture market share from established retailers. For example, CJ Express in Thailand, 99 Speedmart in Malaysia, and B\u00e1ch H\u00f3a Xanh in Vietnam are relative newcomers that have built significant momentum. 2. Polarization. The growth and diversification of the consuming class in Southeast Asia has resulted in early signs of polarization. Premium retailers such as Jaya Grocer and Village Grocer in Malaysia, Annam Group in Vietnam, and Farmers Market and Ranch Market in Indonesia have enjoyed increased demand. So far, discounters have only made limited inroads given the strong presence of traditional trade among more price-sensitive consumers. Exhibit 2 Disruption is influencing the shape of the grocery industry across Southeast Asia. Indonesia Observed at scale Rise of small formats (minimarkets"

The expanding consuming class outside of core urban areas portends faster expansion in rural areas. This demand could give rise to a new competitive set. For example, Vietnamese players Lan Chi Mart and B\u00e1ch H\u00f3a Xanh built their market share outside of main city centers and helped to redistribute the market\u2019s revenue pool. In Indonesia, leading minimart retailers have captured market share in rural areas and tier-two cities. 4. The growth of e-grocery. E-grocery retailers have captured a limited share of the market to date, but they could rapidly challenge established players. Retailers\u2019 own websites and those of aggregators (for example, GoMart, GrabMart, Pandamart, and Shopee Supermarket), as well as social commerce, are on the rise. Social commerce can take many forms, including platforms specializing in group buying, social-media networks integrating sales mechanisms, and smaller sellers communicating directly with customers via chat features. Many retailers are also using dark stores3 to accelerate delivery speed and support the rise of quick commerce (delivery within a couple of hours or even minutes). 5. Consumer behavior strategies. Loyalty and ecosystem strategies have emerged as a powerful force in some markets and are reshaping consumer behavior. While retailers continue to own their consumer databases and innovate to develop stickier relationships, consumer goods companies are also participating in retail to build"

Several Southeast Asian markets are witnessing the rise of eB2B platforms,4 which help shore up the competitiveness of mom-and-pop stores. This evolution, particularly prevalent in countries such as Indonesia, can slow the rise of modern trade, especially in rural areas. Charting a path to profitability The dynamism of the grocery industry is only half the story. Retailers also need to focus on costs, margins, and operating models (Exhibit 3). From 2010 to 2019, most ASEAN retailers focused on grabbing a share of the market and riding the tailwinds of modern trade growth.

A case in point: many hypermarkets in Indonesia and some convenience-store chains in Malaysia and Vietnam still do not break even. Recent macroeconomic developments, such as rising inflation and frequent supply chain disruptions, are putting additional pressure on formats that have yet to reach scale in specific countries, such as convenience stores in Vietnam. Among grocery retailers, the traditional single-minded pursuit of growth and scale shows signs of shifting, with some retailers bucking this trend. For example, Co.op Mart in Vietnam, AEON in Malaysia, and Puregold in the Philippines have managed to sustain annual operating profits over time. Their success is due in part to their long-standing operation in the market, which enables them to focus on controlling costs, determining a suitable profitability equation, and negotiating with suppliers from a position of strength. Emphasizing operational excellence We expect retailers to take further action to achieve profitability through a greater focus on operational excellence, in which the store network is a large component. Our analysis indicates that two areas have the potential to capture net cost savings totaling around 8 to 12 percent of revenue. First, assessing end-to-end 29 Navigating market headwinds \u2013 The state of grocery retail 2022: Southeast Asia store operations can eliminate non-value- added work, automate labor-intensive tasks, and optimize the operating model\u2014 even in markets where the cost of labor is relatively low.

In addition, retailers should actively review commercial terms with suppliers to design a profitable portfolio, including finding a balance for the space of their own brand in each category.

The list goes on. Incumbents have often suffered from poor execution (for example, products without images or any descriptions), rudimentary front- and back-end functionality, and a lack of integration with their offline retail systems. At the same time, newer players have often tried to approach the grocery category with a generic e-commerce lens, trying to replicate for grocery what has worked well for categories such as electronics or household goods. Retailers should adopt a consumer-backed, grocery-specific approach to ensure a fit-for-purpose and seamless customer experience. This effort is especially critical given the high propensity of first-time e-grocery shoppers to revert to offline shopping after a poor initial experience with online shopping. 3. Operational excellence in warehousing, picking and packing, and last-mile logistics. While incumbents are familiar with bulk logistics, bulk breaking, and store replenishment, picking and packing for smaller online orders and last-mile logistics are typically new capabilities that need to be built. Even for newer players, achieving operational excellence, especially in coordinating and routing drivers, is a challenging yet critical element to ensure positive unit economics. Automation will be a critical component: while business cases have traditionally been negative, rising labor shortages and the falling costs of automation can help to tip the scales. 4. Cutting-edge digital, analytics, and technology. Grocery-focused start- ups and ecosystem players will have a head start on digital and analytics, thanks to their tech-first pedigree and access to talent. Incumbents are quickly catching up, however, and are investing heavily in building their own capabilities and transforming legacy technology infrastructure. 5.

Asia is particularly exposed in this regard because Asian consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious (Exhibit 1).1 While climate may be top of mind, it can no longer be separated from other concerns about how we live and make supporting economies more sustainable. To address these problems, it is crucial to consider the food system, which accounts for 34 percent of global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. It\u2019s not simple to reform a system that more than 500 million farmers, workers, and employees around the world depend on, and that plays a critical role in people\u2019s health. Yet the pressure on retailers is increasing (particularly in Asia) as consumers demand sustainable products and services, investors shift to sustainable investments, and regulators implement new and tighter sustainability regulations. Grocers are in a unique position to be a driving force in this much-needed sustainability transformation. They\u2019re ubiquitous, they\u2019re integral to local and national economies, and they have the power to both influence consumer choices and collaborate with farmers, suppliers, and even other grocers. And, finally, they can benefit from the transition because sustainability can go hand in hand with value creation.

The value generated can come from six types of value creation levers, which can be further grouped into reducing downside risks and seizing the opportunities sustainability offers (Exhibit 4). Reducing risks A strong sustainability strategy reduces several downside risks companies might otherwise face (such as increased cost of capital and enhanced reputation of competitors) and can thereby provide an important source of value.

By offering a wider range of healthy and sustainable options and by decarbonizing their operations and the value chain, for example, grocers can gain market share. Capturing opportunities Sustainability strategies can do more than mitigate risk and reduce downsides; such approaches can also give grocers a competitive edge and allow them to take advantage of new opportunities. We outline some potential strategies for grocers below. Portfolio strategy. Grocers can begin reorienting portfolios toward sustainability at the level of their broader ecosystems. They can rigorously allocate capital\u2014for example, by investing in sustainable parts of the business, managing unsustainable parts through cash flow, or scaling down and divesting\u2014and think about organic and inorganic moves. There are many attractive sustainability value pools beyond grocery, often with significantly higher growth and margin potential. Grocers can evaluate the potential to extend beyond their core business, whether by focusing on adjacent segments that strengthen the core business (such as Australia\u2019s Woolworths, which acquired health food retailer Macro Wholefoods Market in 2009 and has since introduced more than 350 products to its stores, including its Macro Whole Living range for cleaning products, which has been certified by Good Environmental Choice Australia [GECA]) or by using consumer data as an ecosystem backbone to provide highly valuable services.

Yet established grocers typically struggle to build new sustainable businesses successfully. While they face real challenges, such as brand credibility and incubating agile new ventures within larger corporate structures, established grocers are also held back by a lack of ambition and an unwillingness to disrupt themselves before someone else does. These are missed opportunities. Established grocers have significant advantages that should make them the natural owners of sustainable-business building. Migros in Switzerland is leading on this front, with its Cultured Food Innovation Hub developing cultured meat, seafood, and more.3 Meanwhile, Asian players are taking small steps. Examples include Vingroup with its sustainable-agriculture unit VinEco in Vietnam, Super Indo with its launch of certified-sustainable cooking oil in Indonesia, and Totoya with its first zero- waste supermarket in Japan.

At the beginning of the pandemic where large-scale social activities were restricted, cold chain industry stakeholders from upstream to downstream used online systems to market food products and attract new consumers. The demand for frozen food, especially fish, poultry (chicken), and beef (animal protein category) increased by 19%, but in the vegetable protein category it decreased by 15% due to unsupported cold chain facilities. a. In fishery products, the use of the cold chain system increased slightly by 2.5% from the previous year, to 3,485 million tons (including 1.26 million tons exported). The total value of the rupiah is IDR 128 trillion (equivalent US$ 9.14 billion). b.

In contrast to other APAC markets, where the logistics sector typically maintains more stable tenancies than o\ufb03 ce spaces, logistics leases in SMA are commonly more elastic except for a few large occupiers such as Coupang, Market Kurly and major parcel companies, some of which incur signi\ufb01 cant capex investments for automation. The average lease period for a logistics asset is about two years, which is shorter than the three-to-\ufb01 ve-year lease term for prime o\ufb03 ce space and thus results in more volatility in the rental market. While varying largely by region, the average rent for cold storage warehouses in the SMA was KRW60,100 per pyeong per month in 2H/2022, nearly double the average of dry storage warehouses (KRW29,000 per pyeong per month) based on face rents, though the e\ufb00 ective rental gap is likely lower.

The quest for yield that in recent years drove global institutions into logistics assets is pushing them increasingly into more specialised warehouse space\u2014particularly cold storage. Challenges to delivering perishable vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic and, more recently, food shortages have underscored the importance of large, reliable refrigerated facilities. Demand for cold storage is growing most rapidly in Asia Pacific, driven by evolving appetites among the region\u2019s expanding middle class and a shift to online grocery and meal deliveries or e-groceries. Key themes include: The global cold supply chain market is expected to grow by a CAGR of 7% to USD 411 billion in 2028, from USD 256 billion in 2021. Asia Pacific\u2019s cold storage market is largely fragmented, outdated and due for replacement. Asia Pacific\u2019s demand for cold storage is likely to grow by at least 20% annually over the next three years, led by Australia, China, and India. Investment in Asia Pacific cold storage could quintuple over the next decade to USD 4-5 billion. Growth is propelled by rising demand from Asia Pacific\u2019s expanding middle class and double-digit growth in e-groceries and other forms of e-commerce. The wider cold-chain market in Asia Pacific is expected to grow at a 12% CAGR from 2021-2028. Cold-storage investment lags 3-4 years behind supply of dry warehouses, where record deals have doubled stock in five years, resulting in sharp yield compression.

Consequently, its pool of cold-storage assets lacks the diversity of the general logistics and industrial sector. Likewise, fewer investors have entered the sector, so liquidity is also lower. Barriers to entry in cold storage, conversely, remain comparatively high. Because cold storage warehouses are usually highly customized and subject to several layers of regulation, they can cost two to three times what a dry warehouse does to build and take several months longer. Cold-storage warehouses typically require specially insulated metal panels, premium concrete, under-floor heating, and refrigeration equipment to keep contents between certain temperatures. This equipment also requires more costly regular maintenance. Facility operators must comply with local and national regulations governing building and worker safety, as well as safety and storage of foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals. These add cost and complexity to operating cold storage facilities, which deters many investors. Asia Pacific\u2019s cold storage market has lagged general warehouse investment As a result, investment in Asia Pacific cold storage has lagged that of general warehouses. The investment volume totalled roughly USD 1 billion in 2021, just 4.3% of conventional warehouse sales the same year, according to MSCI Real Capital Analytics (RCA). But as investor pools deepen and structural tailwinds emerge for the sector, we expect the cold storage investible universe to grow expediently.

Those premiums are now attracting investors as yields in general logistics and the wider industrial sector fall. Cold storage\u2019s higher risks are also offset in many cases by the sector\u2019s benefits, including higher rental premiums, higher occupancy rates, and longer weighted average lease expiries\u2014as well as fixed rental escalation and triple net lease agreements.

Demand for cold storage is underpinned by a combination of fundamental drivers, including real household incomes and consumption, which are cyclical, as well as population growth, which is not. Cold storage has three main groups of customers: food and beverage wholesalers, e-grocers, and pharmaceutical companies. Economic vagaries may affect the composition and quality of the products customers buy, but the products themselves are nondiscretionary. Demand for cold storage is thus somewhat inelastic and less tightly correlated with economic trends. The shift to e-groceries, fed by the"

Even as pandemic restrictions were lifted, online sales have continued to grow, suggesting the shift in consumer habits will outlast the pandemic. 5\u201cNearly 80% of U.S. consumers shopped online for groceries since COVID-19 outbreak,\u201d Supermarket News, May 27, 2020 The rush to meet Asia Pacific\u2019s growing cold storage needs | 11 Rising incomes and urbanization are accelerating these shifts in Asia Pacific These global trends are even more pronounced in Asia Pacific, where they have been intensified and accelerated by more rapid household income growth, expanding cross-border trade in perishable food and a lower level of regional market development. Rapid urbanization and a burgeoning middle class are fuelling demand among Asia Pacific consumers for a more varied range of perishable foodstuffs that must be chilled or frozen before being shipped and stored ahead of distribution, purchase, and consumption. Even as aggregate demand grows, moreover, Asia Pacific is also seeing a shift away from brick-and-mortar, resulting in double-digit growth in e-commerce and e-grocery sales. Over the past several years, Asia Pacific grade A logistics stock has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. Demand for cold storage facilities is now strongest in Australia, China, and India, according"

While China\u2019s online retail market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% between 2020 and 2025, India\u2019s is projected to grow at almost 13% and Indonesia\u2019s at more than 14%. Growing affluence is likewise driving demand for better healthcare, requiring pharmaceuticals that like fresh food are perishable.

The rush to meet Asia Pacific\u2019s growing cold storage needs | 12 Asia Pacific already has an acute shortage of cold storage facilities Asia Pacific already faces a profound shortage of cold storage capacity. Just filling the existing gap would mean adding almost 500 million cubic meters of new supply\u2014more than double the existing cold storage stock. And due to its high energy consumption to power industrial refrigeration, existing facilities face increased pressure to retrofit with greener features. From simply buying electricity through renewable sources, to installing solar panels and implementing IOT technology for auto temperature adjustment, all in the name of meeting net zero carbon targets.

This fragmentation is reflected in the weak standing of many Asia Pacific countries in the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index. Obsolescence in Asia Pacific is so widespread that as much as a third of new supply in recent years has been created by upgrading, replacing, or consolidating existing stock. We estimate between 10-15% of existing, grade A cold storage stock still needs replacement. For existing warehouses run by 3PL (third-party logistics), what we see is operators requiring the tenant to cover the full retrofit cost. This means new investment is needed not only to meet Asia Pacific\u2019s new demand, but also to accommodate customers that need to replace their current facilities.

Similar reallocations are accelerating logistics investment in Asia Pacific This shift is also underway in Asia Pacific. We expect logistics investment to expand from just 16% of regional portfolio allocations to roughly 30%. Last year, we predicted that investment in Asia Pacific logistics and industrial assets would double by 2025, to USD 50-60 billion, from USD 25-30 billion in 2019-2020. This target was almost reached by the end of that year, when"

Cold storage is likely to become a distinct asset class as it grows The return performance of the conventional warehouse segment makes a compelling case for the cold storage market. Figure 1 illustrates how closely the pair tracks one another, keeping in mind investment in cold storage remains roughly 3-4 years behind that of general warehouses. The continued level of new supply for Asia Pacific\u2019s general warehouse has contributed to record levels of deal activity in the sector since 2018. Grade A warehouse stock has nearly doubled over the last five years, yet cold storage supply remained stagnant until recently. The experience of Japan and South Korea offers insight into the future for Asia Pacific cold storage. Both countries accounted for nearly half of the region\u2019s total investment in general warehouses over the past three years. As supplies in the two countries climbed, deal activity rose sharply, and yield compression subsequently followed, creating a positive feedback loop. We expect the same pattern to be repeated in the region\u2019s cold storage sector over the next several years.

We estimate cold storge deals to make up nearly 10% of the logistics investment volume, given we expect cold storage stock to account for between 10-15% of overall logistics stock. Investment in Asia Pacific\u2019s cold storage market could quintuple over the next decade,9 to at least USD 4-5 billion, with the region\u2019s cold chain market growing at a 12% CAGR between 2021 and 2028. These estimates may prove conservative: In our Future of Global Logistics Real Estate survey last year, 91% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that cold storage demand in Asia Pacific would rise over the next three years by more than 20%. As investors seeking alternative assets turn to cold storage and the sector is established as a critical link in global supply chains, we foresee it becoming a distinct asset class requiring its own portfolio allocation.10 Figure 9: The cold chain logistics market by region from 2020 to 2024 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 USD Billions North America APAC Europe Source: Statista 9Asia Pacific Capital Tracker 1Q22, p. 19. 10The Future of Global Logistics Real Estate, 2021 \u00a9 2022 All rights reserved.
