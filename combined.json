Hau Giang Cold Storage Logistics is eager for completion of the first cold storage centre in the Mekong Delta province of Hau Giang, in which construction was started in July. Investors eager to boost cold storage Illustrative photo (Source: VNA) The centre will combine six cold storage units and one cool unit at capacity of over 88,000 tonnes. The units, which cost a total of VND500 billion ($21.7 million), will be installed with modern technology imported from the EU. The first one is expected to welcome goods from the third quarter of 2023. The construction of the remaining storage in the centre will be slated for 2027, with an average construction speed of 1-2 units per year. Company director Nguyen Van Kich said, \u201cThe demand is increasing because the export activity of fruit and seafood are being fostered. The current supply source has yet to meet the demand.\u201d At present, the network just concentrates on Can Tho and Hau Giang with a capacity of 50,000 pallets of seafood. \u201cWe have experience in preserving frozen seafood. Thus, we are confident that our service will meet the strict requirement in the storage of foreign clients,\u201d Kich added. Indo-Trans Logistics Corporation (ITL) is meanwhile accelerating its plan to lead the cold storage market with over 50,000 pallets by next year. According to the plan, ITL wants to set up a new company combining ITL Keppel and ITL Logistics, which is managing its warehouses across the country. The new company will specialise in warehousing and cold chain development with modern technology in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, and will provide 350,000sq.m of warehouse space, over 300 small trucks, and 50,000"

As of early October, Vietnam currently has approximately 70 cold storage units with the capacity of over 800,000 pallets, which concentrate in Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta region, according to the statistics published by the Vietnam Logistics Business Association. The largest cold storage area in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, of nearly four hectares and a total investment of VND1.3 trillion ($56.5 million), is located in Tan Tao Industrial Park of Binh Tan district in Ho Chi Minh City, operated by Hung Vuong JSC. The area is equipped with 60,000 pallets, with a capacity of 60,000-70,000 tonnes of goods. The company is preparing a plan to invest in another unit at Hiep Phuoc port. Le Minh Phung, marketing director of AJ Total Vietnam \u2013 a South Korean chain operator with three units in Vietnam \u2013 said the company has plans to invest in an additional 5-6 units. \u201cThe factor fostering the development of this segment is the improvement of infrastructure in the Mekong Delta. Besides that, having easy access to capital has helped seafood companies build their own warehouses on a considerable scale, and most companies can build themselves warehouses meeting international standards,\u201d Phung said. The remarkable development of the fruit and vegetable export industry, especially export to China, had created a sudden growth in the system of storing, cooling, and transporting fruits and vegetables in the north-south direction. \u201cFurthermore, the participation of multinationals and large private corporations in Vietnam in the retail market has created a remarkable development in cold storage,\u201d Phung added.

This figure contributes to making Vietnam become the world\u2019s third-largest seafood exporter, accounting for 7 per cent of global market share. According to Cushman & Wakefield, the lack of cold storage units is an opportunity for the segment. While demand is high, only a few enterprises have invested and no-one can provide full related services. Only 14 per cent of cold storage is from logistics companies and the remainder is held by members of the Vietnam Logistics Business Association, such as Transimex, Gemadept, and Saigon Newport. Supply is more plentiful in the south as demand there is higher, while 60 per cent of the market share is in the hands of foreign investors, Cushman & Wakefield reported.

Investment picked up, exports boomed, inflation was low, and the budget deficit was lower than forecast. Key reforms were implemented last year, and stronger growth is expected for 2022. The downside risks are the economic impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and potential COVID-19 outbreaks are still of concern. The medium-term challenge is to harness digitalization to raise productivity and growth. Indonesian cold chain relativity The current National Logistics Capacity for all materials is 31,000,000 Tons. * (latest numbers) Of which cold chain sector is 1,920,000 tons. Majority of Cold Chain operations companies are registered in ARPI the Asosiasi Rantai Pendingin Indonesia (Indonesian Cold Chain Association) and ALFI the Asosiasi Logistics Freight Forwarders Indonesia.

This is also a requirement for export and import business of fishery products, meat, fruit and vegetables and the ice cream industry. An example of a major protein producer is shown below. October 2022 4 Indonesian cold chain players Based on a survey conducted by CIC, at the end of 2018, there were around 69 major cold storage companies throughout Indonesia with a total capacity of 370,000 tons per year. The number one Company being PT Enseval Putera Megatrading Tbk (EPMT), which is responsible for delivering pharmaceuticals for Kalbe and third-party principal products to over 1 million outlets in Indonesia. In addition, Kalbe has also expanded the business portfolio of the Division to include raw material trading, medical device trading and retail and health services. Kalbe\u2019s distribution and Logistic network for pharmaceuticals products is the most extensive in Indonesia. The table below shows the top 10 companies. To maintain a cold storage facility requires a substantial investment, and it\u2019s not surprising that many companies do not have their own cold storage facilities. Rather, many of them rent or cooperate with cold storage owners. This makes it is very difficult to know the exact amount of cold storage operation in Indonesia.

Cold Storage services include refrigerators, chilled rooms, thawing rooms, freezer rooms, blast chillers and blast freezers. Greater Jakarta has more than 40 cold chain companies with major location of cold storage being North Jakarta, West Jakarta, and Bekasi. The basic storage types can be divided simply into Industrial and Commercial. Commercial sites are for business activities such as logistics and supply chain management hubs and generally have the capacity of below 500 tons, these units are generally leased or rented. The industrial storage facilities have more than 500 tons capacity and function usually as a part of production facility. However, there is a growing trend of new build cold storage warehouses. One of the noted changes evident post the pandemic is that Cold Chain and refrigerated Cold storage always used to be pallet in and pallet out. Now, like many sectors, refrigerated is transitioning to pallet in and case out or pallet in and singles out. This is largely driven by Ecommerce and cold chain players recognizing that the increase of more B2C (Business to Consumer) & D2C (Direct to Consumer). Which in turn will require more, smaller, storage spaces, usually for fulfilment purposes. Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world and the second largest producer of seafood.

These risks only double when it comes to medications and pharmaceutical goods, which the Covid-19 pandemic further highlighted through the transportation of temperature-sensitive vaccines. Temperature sensitive products also need to be monitored each step of the supply chain link with data tracking technology to ensure their viability for end-use. Any break in protocol will result in the loss of the product due to spoiled ingredients that must be transported at set temperatures.

October 2022 10 Foodservice cold chain Demand drivers of growth The Grocery market is a key driver of Cold Chain Logistics, as cold storage reduces food losses during transport & storage. Growing affluence of consumers has led to increased demand for fresh products causing supermarkets and their suppliers to increase capacity of cold chain logistics. Cold storage logistics is a sector that has gained traction in recent months due to the growing opportunities for drug and vaccine imports and exports, coupled with the spike for online retail and food delivery services. October 2022 11 Prospects look good Over the medium to long term, increasing affluence of the middle class in the region, fueled by rapid economic development will also underpin the strong pace of growth of the cold chain market. According to Ernst & Young, Asia Pacific\u2019s middle class will amount to 3.3 billion in 2030 or two-thirds of the global middle class, up from just one-third in 2009. The outlook for the cold storage logistics sector is bright as its fundamentals have been upgraded given the consumer behavioral changes for grocery shopping and surge in demand for biopharmaceuticals. 62 818150373 Service Offerings \u2022 Supply Chain Operational Health Checks \u2022 White paper preparation on industry specific topics \u2022 Safety Obsessed Health & Safety Reviews"

        "text": "of both tariff and non-tariff barriers and fulfilling its commitment in several regional trade agreements, the country has made remarkable achievements in trade liberalization. Vietnam\u2019s major trade partners located in East Asia, North America, and Europe are reached mostly by sea or air. Trade with bordering neighbors is limited and thus trade across border-crossing points is minimal except for northern borders with China, which has seen growth in recent years. The country\u2019s trade flows are concentrated at twelve of its 48 border gates\u2014two airports, five seaports and five border crossing points\u2014which collectively handled 86 percent of total trade value in 2016.1 As the trade grows, congestion at and near these international gateways and border-crossing points has also increased. In addition to the current major trade partners, various regional trade relations and connectivity initiatives are relevant to Vietnam, including with Southeast Asian neighbors, and South Asia\u2014particularly India\u2014over land, given the rapidly growing trade relationships. In the meantime, Vietnam\u2019s transport network has undergone a significant expansion over the past decades. The most remarkable development in network expansion has occurred in the road sector. As of 2016 the total length of the road network, excluding village roads, reached over 300,000 km, including about 1,000 km of expressways\u2014a fully access-controlled toll road system. Vietnam is endowed with an extensive network of natural waterways, including nearly 16,000 km of managed navigable routes carrying significant traffic around the Red River Delta and Mekong Delta areas. However, only about 2,600 km of the waterways can reliably handle barges greater than 300 deadweight tons, with rudimentary terminal infrastructure at most of its numerous river ports. Vietnam\u2019s century-old railway system is mostly single-tracked and non-electrified, which has remained unchanged over the past decades with very limited capital investments. Vietnam\u2019s extensive seaport system includes 45 ports and nearly 200 terminals."

Some of the key seaports operate at or near capacity, with limited room for capacity expansion due to their confines within built-up urban areas. Traffic congestion around these ports and along the connecting national highway systems exacerbates cargo movement, causing delays Executive Summary 2 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared Prosperityand negatively affecting the urban mobility of these major cities. Vietnam\u2019s aviation sector has seen rapid growth in the recent years, with its air freight growing at an average rate of 10.8 percent per year from 2009 to 2017. Despite the growing importance of air freight transportation, which accounts for about 25 percent of Vietnam\u2019s export and import value, infrastructure is still limited. Only four of 22 airports in Vietnam have separate cargo terminals, and two have onsite logistics centers. Despite this remarkable success, Vietnam still faces many connectivity challenges. The quality and extent of transport infrastructure is uneven across the country; some key trade corridors and international gateways are growing increasingly congested while others remain underutilized or underdeveloped, as seen with logistics services, especially the segment serving the domestic markets. Natural disasters and other hazards pose increasing threats to the country\u2019s infrastructure and livelihood. With these complex challenges in the backdrop, in this report we examine the link between connectivity and three critical development goals of Vietnam\u2014integration, inclusion and resilience. Integrating with Global Markets Vietnam\u2019s trade grew alongside its deepening global integration and participation into global value chains. The revolution in information and communication technologies and falling transportation and communications costs drove offshoring and unbundling of production from the developed to the developing world and gave rise to global value chains. As an active participant in global value chains,"

        "text": "Vietnam benefits from jobs and knowledge created from its involvement in multinational corporation production. For this report, we explored how Vietnam\u2019s integration with global markets can be further supported through a connectivity strategy, and in doing so, carried out an extensive spatial analysis to address the following questions: \u2022 Which specific sectors or value chains require the most attention? \u2022 Are some value chains more dependent on transport and logistics connectivity than others? \u2022 Which corridors will prove critical as Vietnam aspires to improve its trade competitiveness? Our analysis has resulted in identification of \u201cvalue chain critical\u201d transport corridors for nine value chains, which combined account for over 70 percent of Vietnam\u2019s export.2 Geographically, these key corridors are located (a) around the largest economic centers\u2014Hanoi and HCMC\u2014connecting nearby provinces that participate in the value chains, (b) between Mekong delta region and HCMC, (c) between Hanoi and northern Chinese borders, (d) along the north-south coastal line, and (e) between central highlands and the south. Ensuring quality infrastructure and necessary logistics services along these corridors would help lower the trade and transport costs associated with these value chains, which are crucial for Vietnam\u2019s export competitiveness. Vietnam\u2019s international trade is predominantly handled at a handful of key airports, seaports, and border crossing points. With the rapid increase in air cargos, many stakeholders are increasingly concerned with the physical and operational capacities at key airports. Two historically dominant seaports in Ho Chi Minh City and Haiphong operate near capacity, with connecting roads plagued 3 Executive Summarywith burgeoning congestion. At the same time, the relatively new deep-sea ports in Vung Tau seaport complex and Lach Huyen present opportunities to further consolidate cargo, attract large intercontinental vessels, and hence lower transport costs and transit time. Investments in hinterland connectivity are critical for success of these ports."

Economic clusters in Vietnam, in the form of industrial parks or economic zones, have been developed around main corridors, near primary international gateways, or around major urban areas. Their success, measured in terms of investments attracted and employment generated, is affected by connectivity, along with other factors. As Vietnam develops a major high-capacity, high- speed transport network\u2014such as the North\u2013South Expressway\u2014thereby shortening economic distances across the country, new transport nodes are created as potential candidates for future economic clusters.

Integrating Domestic Markets The Vietnamese population is growing richer and more urban. The \u201cconsumer class,\u201d which consumes US$5.50 or more per person per day, is rapidly expanding from about 49 percent in 2010 to over 70 percent in 2016. Approximately 89 percent of urban dwellers belong to the consumer class, compared to around 66 percent of the rural population. This emerging group consumes more, and more diverse, goods and services than their poorer counterparts. These changes in consumption patterns, caused by a sharp rise of incomes, could lead to changes in what is moved where, how, and at what costs. Vietnam faces complex food problems related to the supply, distribution, and quality assurance for fresh perishable foods. Despite the rapid surge in consumer demand for fresh foods, especially in urban areas, the supply and distribution channels have undergone remarkably little change: consumers"

Increasing demand for fresh foods, combined with persistent traditional methods of moving and distributing foods, have resulted in significant food losses, unsafe foods, negative environmental impacts, and public health threats. In order to develop efficient, sustainable, and safe food chains, Vietnamese cities need to overhaul their market infrastructure and improve the governance around food chains through regulatory coordination. Generating sufficient demand for safe and traceable food, through raising awareness among consumers and building trust in the system is also important, as greater demand would mean a higher willingness-to-pay for safer food, which would then create greater demand for sophisticated transportation and logistics services for food, such as cold chain transportation and storages. 4 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityRelated to the above specific concerns around food chains, Vietnam\u2019s logistics service providers, especially those serving domestic markets, are still small in scale and have much room to embrace technologies to improve their efficiency. The trucking sector, which is among the most critical players in the logistics sector, is highly fragmented with about half of the companies generating annual revenues of around US$0.5 million. In a national survey, truck operators reported that about 60 to 70 percent of the time, their trucks return empty. Underdeveloped non-asset-based brokerage and intermediary services, along with limited automation and use of technology further constrain the ability of the trucking sector to consolidate cargo efficiently. Together, the state of logistics services and the emerging trends of e-commerce signify new connectivity needs. E-commerce is growing rapidly in Vietnam and offers opportunity for growth, as it can improve productivity and lower the search and transaction costs, both for producers and consumers.

All of these bring additional challenges in fast-growing, congested cities in Vietnam, which are faced with competing urban mobility needs, namely between daily commutes and urban freight transport.

The analysis shows the improvements in transport infrastructure increased market access, which in turn increases wages and attracts more population. During the last decade, the travel time and transport costs from most localities of Vietnam to major urban areas and international gateways has reduced significantly, thanks to the expansion of the transport network and improvement of road conditions. Over the period from 2009 to 2017, improvements in connectivity have raised national welfare and real incomes for all communes. For instance, welfare benefits result from increases in domestic trade within the country due to reduction in travel time. Connectivity improvements from 2009 to 2017 have slowed down the concentration rate of workers in the main two urban poles, benefiting more distant areas in the Northwest and along the coastline. We also tested the potential impacts of future connectivity improvements on national real income and spatial inequality, under two scenarios: the first focuses on upgrading or rehabilitating national highways mostly in remote areas and near border-crossing points, while the second completes the planned North\u2013South Expressway.

Building Resilience Vietnam\u2019s extensive transport network is exposed to various hazards, including landslide, fluvial (river) flooding, typhoon, and flash flooding, all of which are increasing in intensity and frequency due to climate change. With 60 percent of its land area and 71 percent of its population exposed to risk, Vietnam ranks high as a natural disaster hotspot of two or more multihazard events, which could result in annual average asset losses amounting to 1.5 percent of GDP and loss in consumption amounting to 2 percent of GDP. With events of extreme intensity expected to become more frequent due to climate change, Vietnam\u2019s major sea, air, and river ports are similarly exposed to natural hazards and thus to the risks of major flow disruption. The potential economic impacts of disruptions related to natural hazards could be significant, accounting for increases in transport costs of rerouting and reduction in production due to input\u2013output linkages of goods moved on the affected transport link.

We found that multimodal transport could be a resilient strategy in that less reliance on one mode would reduce the expected economic losses. Building truly multimodal connectivity, however, is a challenging task that would require improvement in infrastructure, regulatory framework, market incentives, and development of logistics services. Currently, the key bottlenecks preventing Vietnam from achieving efficient multimodal connectivity include (a) the lack of containerization on inland waterway transport, (b) underdeveloped river ports with poor land connectivity and rudimentary cargo handling equipment, and (c) underutilized potential of domestic coastal shipping constrained both by infrastructure and market structures. Overcoming these roadblocks to achieving a more resilient transport system in Vietnam would require concerted efforts across multiple stakeholders. For better connectivity for Vietnam, we propose actions around nine key recom- mendations: 1. Re-orient transport and spatial planning to support critical value chains. Transport planning and investment strategies need be informed by value chain criticality, so that connectivity can best serve Vietnam\u2019s further integration with the global markets. At present, trade information, especially on value chains, is rarely used in policy formulation or infrastructure investment decisions. In order to mainstream such practices, the entire eco-system of trade and transport links needs to be created, including systematic collection of relevant trade and transport data, a system where such data are consolidated and analyzed, and procedures by which the analytical outputs have tangible influence over the planning and investment decision processes. The ongoing efforts by the Ministry of Transport (MoT) to establish the Vietnam Logistics Statistical System need to be completed and further built upon. 2.

As Vietnam\u2019s trade grows, capacities at its largest international gateways grow increasingly constrained, while several gateways face serious inland connectivity issues. To address these challenges, Vietnam needs to further develop new gateways with greater capacity and efficiency (in the case of the planned Long Thanh airport and Lach Huyen seaport), while improving coordination across the central and provincial governments in ensuring hinterland connectivity of main gateways. Moreover, we recommend considering these critical gateways as a network with complementary roles and discouraging wasteful competition among various localities. Consolidation at gateways with the structure and capabilities to handle intercontinental vessels, supported by good domestic shipping and land connectivity, is beneficial for importers, exporters, and shippers alike, as such an arrangement can significantly lower transit time and reduce trade costs with some of Vietnam\u2019s major trade partners. 3. Create \u201ceconomic densities\u201d along new corridors. Vietnam\u2019s newly developing high- capacity high-speed connective infrastructure provides unique opportunity to reduce \u201ceconomic distances\u201d while creating \u201ceconomic densities.\u201d Both outcomes can be achieved by allowing targeted 7 Executive Summarydevelopment around \u201chigh value\u201d transport nodes created around new infrastructure, such as expressways.

While LSPs serving the foreign direct investment (FDI) sector expand and become more sophisticated, domestic trade is still primarily served by rudimentary services. With a growing number of urban consumers increasingly demanding competitive prices along with higher standards of services, such as safety, punctuality, freshness, and traceability of traded goods, this presents an opportune moment for growth of LSPs serving the domestic markets. The government can support this private-sector-driven development by creating an enabling regulatory environment, enforcing standards, and \u201cnudging\u201d the consumers to support a competitive market, accomplished through raising awareness around safe food chain, employing policies to support upscaling the LSP and bringing in new technologies, and encouraging creation of brokerage and intermediary services, including third-party or fourth-party logistics. 5. Overhaul market infrastructure and logistics in cities. Vietnamese cities should upgrade, and in some cases relocate, their market infrastructure, which is predominantly outdated and in traditional forms (for example, wet markets). Currently, with few exceptions, matters of needs, risk and performance of food system and other urban consumption activities are not mainstreamed into urban land-use planning, logistics, environmental management or overall municipal governance. And, in most agricultural strategies and plans, cities are identified as end points for consumption, but not as active, responsible players in governance of supply chains including for food. Moreover, consideration for urban logistics is often omitted in the current practices of transport planning in major urban areas. Logistics facilities of various hierarchy, such as inland container depots, cargo handling facilities at critical interurban connection points (railway stations, domestic airports, and ports, for instance), urban distribution centers, and small warehousing in urban areas, should be brought into the domain of the formal transport planning process, to"

Connect low-density communities to markets. Vietnam should continue providing connectivity for remote and low-density areas of the country,3 to reduce economic distance and improve market access for all localities, by connecting them to main economic corridors rather than nearby, similarly low-density adjacent localities. Our empirical analysis provides evidence that connectivity brings more employment opportunities, greater wages, better opportunities to participate in domestic and international trade, and thus improved welfare. We also found that connectivity can offset the negative impacts of low density on employment potential and wages, and thus, providing connectivity proves even more critical for low-density communes in the country. 8 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared Prosperity7. Complement connectivity with social and economic support. Vietnam should employ complementary policies such as lowering barriers to labor mobility and providing universal access to quality education and health, in parallel with the investments and policies for connectivity improvement. Our analysis shows that with no constraints to labor mobility, improved connectivity will reduce spatial inequality. By facilitating free movement of people to locations that offer opportunities for better jobs and higher wages\u2014thanks in part to better connectivity\u2014the economy as a whole can maximize the benefits of improved connectivity. At the household level, while good market access strongly correlates with positive economic outcomes (accounting for 30 to 34 percent of the gaps in off-farm employment across different geographical locations and ethnicities), the remaining gaps could be explained by other factors, such as education attainment and agriculture related endowments and resources. Therefore, to be sufficient for inclusive welfare increase for all populations in Vietnam, improved connectivity should be accompanied by complementary policies. 8.

Promote multimodal transport as a resilient strategy. Vietnam\u2019s economic activities rely heavily on its increasingly congested road network, part of which is vulnerable to natural disasters. At the same time, Vietnam\u2019s natural endowment such as an inland waterway network and long coastal lines, is underutilized and not fully explored.

These scales include connectivity within the immediate Southeast Asia neighborhood, and the evolving and expanding links with China as well as to South Asia. Deepening intra-ASEAN connectivity is among the ongoing priority trade initiatives for Vietnam. Vietnam has a long history of cooperation on connectivity within the sub-region, through its participation in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) initiative, launched in 1992 by Vietnam and five other riparian states of the Mekong River (Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Thailand). The program, still under implementation, focuses on cross-border infrastructure development in a few priority economic corridors with the goal of enhancing economic cooperation among the participating economies. While some of these corridors are lightly traveled, the GMS region\u2019s basic core infrastructure could support further trade integration. 15 Chapter 1: Vietnam \u2013 The State of ConnectivityAnother, potentially more consequential regional connectivity initiative involving Vietnam is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Master Plan for Connectivity (MPAC 2025), which includes all ten economies in the ASEAN.

MPAC 2025 is intended to guide the development of infrastructure for further integration within ASEAN. The short-term priorities for Vietnam and its ASEAN neighbors focus on completing the core regional network, such as highway corridors between Vietnam and Cambodia or Lao PDR. The medium-term agenda includes establishing new highway or railway connections between these countries, along the corridors with increasing trade volume. For instance, in recent years, Vietnam\u2019s National Highway 22 between Ho Chi Minh City and the Moc Bai border gate to Cambodia has seen traffic growth at more than 7 percent per year (World Bank 2019a). Improvement of these corridors, and the resulting time savings will become increasingly important across the ASEAN region as the region upgrades to predominantly higher value goods. Therefore, participating countries must approach the core regional network development, consisting of these critical trade corridors, in a coordinated manner. Ultimately, the benefits of connectivity will be maximized when a network is appropriately interconnected, especially by completing links between the most important nodes. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a large-scale initiative that focuses on enhancing global connectivity, may present opportunity for Vietnam to leverage its potential. Vietnam is one of more than seventy countries participating in the BRI. Vietnam is part of the China Indochina Peninsula Economic Corridor (CICPEC) intended to enhance connectivity between the following key cities: Nanning (China), Hanoi, Vientiane (Lao PDR), Ho Chi Minh City, Phnom Penh (Cambodia), Bangkok (Thailand), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), and Singapore. Recent estimates by the World Bank (World Bank 2019b) suggest that trade costs for East Asia economies would fall from implementing BRI-associated projects and trade facilitation measures.

This new railway connection will interconnect with the Thailand system, and could potentially be interlinked via a Vietnam\u2013Cambodia railway link and to a proposed high-speed railway in Vietnam between Hanoi and HCMC. While the feasibility of such a significant undertaking should be carefully assessed, a network-level assessment suggests that completing these core BRI networks could enhance the centrality and importance of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in the network of cities in Southeast Asia (Derudder, Liu, and Kunaka 2018). An increase in centrality will make the center more attractive for investment and as traffic intermediation nodes in the region. 16 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityWhile the infrastructure improvements are ongoing, logistics operations have been initiated along segments of the main corridors, such as the train container services between China and Vietnam. The introduction of block-train container services between China and Vietnam have helped to reduce goods shipping costs between the two countries and reduced some past constraints encountered with individual wagonload traffic (Bullock, Liu, and Tan 2019). Sending freight across borders in individual wagonloads often meant long delays waiting for connections, and especially for other processes such as transshipment or customs inspections. Block container services have proven much cheaper, especially from same origin to same destination. This outcome points to the importance of consolidating regional traffic at a handful of nodes and along a few cross-border routes. The effects of border procedures and attendant delays are most visible with road transport, which incur significant amounts of time and costs. Table 1.1 shows a cost comparison of shipping goods in a container by road and rail, and over similar distances between China and Vietnam.1 The costs of shipping by road"

In addition, Vietnam also signed several trade agreements that opened access to new market access. More recently, the country has pursued deeper integration with ASEAN partners, participating in larger agreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and agreements with the European Union. However, the ability to realize the full potential of the various agreements is hampered by a proliferation of complicated and burdensome non-tariff measures (NTMs) constraining trade.2 Thus, streamlining of NTMs is important for facilitating preferential market access between Vietnam and some new markets, especially South Asia. Vietnam\u2019s Transport Network Within the mainland Vietnam, the transport network has undergone significant expansion over the past decades, improving the connectivity of all localities in the country to these international gateways. Most remarkable development in network expansion occurred in the road sector. The total length of the road network, excluding village roads, more than tripled since 1992, reaching over 300,000 km as of 2016 (figure 1.4). As a result, the number of commune centers without access to all weather roads decreased from more than 600 in 1997 to 65 in 2016.TABLE 1.2.

In northern Vietnam a network of lines links Hanoi with the port at Haiphong, as well as two lines to border crossings with China at Dong Dang and Lao Cai. In addition to the public network, industrial rail systems, with a total length of 120 km, primarily serve mineral and industrial enterprises undertaking their own operations. The Vietnam railway system currently carries about 10.5 million passengers (or 4 billion passenger-km) and 5.5 million freight tons (or 3.9 billion ton-km) annually. With volumes remaining mostly constant for the last several years, railway accounts for under 5 percent of the country\u2019s total movement of goods and people. Vietnam\u2019s extensive seaport system includes 45 ports and nearly 200 terminals. Maritime cargo throughput has continued to increase, as has the share of domestic throughput via coastal or short-sea shipping (see figure 1.6). As illustrated in figure 1.3 above, the two seaport complexes in the north (Haiphong) and in the south (HCMC) serve as the primary international gateways and handle much of the country\u2019s trade volume. These ports operate at or near capacity, with limited room for capacity expansion due to their confined locations within built-up urban areas.

Vietnam\u2019s first deep-sea port, the Vung Tau seaport complex, lies approximately 50 km south from the existing HCMC port complex, has been developed to handle up to 180,000 DWT vessels. However, the container volume handled in this port complex is far below its capacity due to the inadequate hinterland connectivity by land and IWT. In the northern part of the country, the first container terminal at the Lach Huyen deep- sea port in Haiphong, further east from the existing Haiphong Complex, started operating in 2018. Several other deep-sea ports have opened as well, including Tien Sa in Danang and Cai Lan in Quang Ninh province.

Based on this, one could argue that Vietnam is doing relatively well in terms of connectivity and is connected to where it needs to be connected, internationally and domestically. While recognizing successes and achievements, however, we argue the current state of connectivity presents many challenges, both present and future. Behind the rapid expansion of the physical capacity of transport infrastructure is the issue of mismatch between connectivity demand and supply. The overall system heavily relies on road transport, which carries three-quarters of total cargo volumes, with very few multimodal trips due to weak intermodal links. Routes, therefore, are not optimized. In many parts of the network, worsening congestion costs the economy significant productivity losses and causes pollution; meanwhile, other parts of the network remain underutilized, rendering the investments ineffective.

Vietnam\u2019s heavy exposure to various types of natural hazard\u2014among them typhoons, flooding, and landslides\u2014means potential serious vulnerability of the built infrastructures and overwhelming needs to ensure resilience. From this global benchmarking, Vietnam\u2019s quality of trade and transport-related infrastructure apparently has not been able to keep pace with its trade growth and development. The trade competitiveness potential in Vietnam is constrained by the lack of policy orientation toward promoting trade-oriented connectivity. The external and domestic changes in Vietnam, including evolving international trade relationships, the country\u2019s comparative advantages in global economy, and its rapidly changing patterns of domestic consumption, will have implications on future connectivity needs. Because trade has grown in Vietnam much faster than in other countries, at the current GDP and level of openness, the country might be vulnerable to volatile global trends, especially when considering the recent rise in protectionism and trade tension. This means that in addition to its current strong GVC participation, Vietnam might need to further diversify its trade partners and expand its domestic consumption base.

The recent World Bank report, Vietnam at a Crossroads: Engaging in the Next Generation of Global Value Chains (Hollweg, Smith, and Taglioni 2017), notes that Vietnam\u2019s connections to international trade networks are good, but less strong than with its neighboring countries, which limits regional competitiveness. The report further notes that poor efficiency of customs clearance, weak infrastructure quality, and the quality and competence of service providers limits logistics and trade facilitation. Vietnam has thus room to develop in regional value chain trade, greater network centrality, participation relative to per capita income, and strengthened forward and backward links. The changing geopolitical relationships among Vietnam\u2019s key trade partners and global trade patterns, and these external conditions could have significant impacts on Vietnam\u2019s growth potential, its roles in future value chains, and jobs (Cunningham and Pimhidzai 2018). Vietnam\u2019s trade and transport connectivity could affect how Vietnam responds to, and influences, the external conditions. The second dimension of integration is that of domestic markets, which consists of rural and urban links and connectivity around and within growing urban areas. Vietnam\u2019s urbanization is still very much in progress, both in terms of population and physical footprint of its growing cities. Its expanding middle-class population predominantly resides in urban areas, with their rising incomes and rapidly changing consumption patterns and habits. This richer and more urban population is more reliant on traded consumption than on self-produced consumption. Thus, better domestic connectivity would be needed to serve this growing consumer base, including connectivity for food supply logistics, urban mobility, and the emergent e-commerce sector. Faced with uncertainties and risks around international trade, the \u201cconsumer class\u201d and domestic markets in Vietnam provide a new opportunity for its growth, calling for attention to the domestic connectivity"

Despite the commendable efforts made by the government to date, spatial disparity across the country remains vast and most of the remaining poverty is concentrated in remote areas and among ethnic minorities. This changing nature of poverty reduction is combined with physical remoteness and low access to infrastructure, services, and market opportunities. There still are pockets of very remote areas with limited economic opportunities other than subsistence farming. In order to solve this \u201clast-mile\u201d problem of the inclusion agenda, it is important to understand the impacts of the past improvement in connectivity on the economic outcomes of individuals and households depending on their locations. By analyzing how connectivity can affect economic outcomes, the direction for future interventions can be set out. As a growing middle-income country with a large stock of existing infrastructure assets, fostering resilience is a crucial foundation for Vietnam to sustain its development and well- being of the society and individuals. Vietnam has suffered significant economic losses during recent years in the form of damages to infrastructure and livelihood, and furthermore, is among the most vulnerable countries to worsening natural disasters due to climate change.

The chapter covers value chain-critical transport corridors, performance and efficiency of international gateways, and the relationship between economic clusters and corridor development. Chapter 3: Integrating Domestic Markets\u2014Analyzes connectivity for domestic consumers in the context of the emergence of urban middle-class consumers, which has given rise to demand for e-commerce and perishable foods in cities. The chapter also discusses the connectivity implications of recent trends as well as the challenges of urban logistics. Chapter 4: Delivering on \u201cLast-Mile\u201d\u2014Focuses on Inclusion, and the role of connectivity in achieving inclusiveness of economic growth in Vietnam. The chapter provides a conceptual link between connectivity and economic outcomes, measurement of connectivity in terms of market access, empirical relationships between market access on economic outcomes, and the welfare effects of transport network development. Chapter 5: Building Resilience\u2014Provides an in-depth analysis on the vulnerability of transport connectivity and how Vietnam can improve resilience through network analysis and prioritization techniques.

Trade\u2014especially export\u2014competitiveness is largely determined by trade costs as well as costs for goods and services. Trade costs comprise tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and transport and logistics costs (TLC). As tariffs on international trade have been sharply reduced and manufacturing costs have increased, Vietnam\u2019s export competitiveness increasingly depends on factors such as quality, productivity, efficient supply chains, and lower transport and logistics costs. This chapter examines Vietnam\u2019s participation in GVCs, its spatial relationship between trade and transport, and the way in which trade and transport infrastructure can be improved to support Vietnam\u2019s trade competitiveness. 29 Chapter 2: Integrating with Global MarketsVietnam and the Global Value Chain1 Global empirical evidence shows that trade promotes growth. Through increased competition, trade reallocates resources toward more productive sectors and firms and boosts real incomes by lowering prices for consumers and firms. And by supporting growth, trade openness can also be an important driver of poverty reduction. During the period between 1960 and 1990, eight high- performing Asian economies in terms of trade\u2014Japan; Republic of Korea; Taiwan, China; Hong Kong SAR, China; Singapore; Malaysia; Indonesia; and Thailand\u2014had an average growth rate of 5.5 percent per year, higher and more sustainable than any other groups of countries in the world (Birdsall and others 1993). Vietnam is no exception. The export-led growth strategy and global integration adopted in Vietnam have been key factors, among other things, for Vietnam\u2019s remarkable achievement over the last more than two-and-half decades in generating economic growth and poverty reduction. During the period from 1992 to 2017, Vietnam developed into one of the world\u2019s most open trading countries, with an export-to-GDP ratio of more than 100 percent in 2017.

Since 1995, Vietnam has carved out a role for itself within GVCs, showing higher integration as a buyer and a seller in GVCs. An improved business environment for attracting qualified foreign direct investments (FDI) has promoted Vietnam\u2019s participation in a number of GVCs. Between 1995 and 2011, Vietnam grew its domestic value added\u2014embodied in its gross export\u2014by 16.6 percent annually, just below what had been achieved by China. By specializing in assembly functions on behalf of primarily foreign firms, Vietnam\u2019s export-oriented development strategy has created jobs, propelled economic growth, and reduced poverty. As a result of GVC participation, Vietnam\u2019s export structure has changed dramatically, both in terms of technology embodied in export and product-based export. Figure 2.2 shows a significant structural change in technology embodied in export during the period between 1997 and 2017. The demonstration is built on UNComtrade\u2019s international classification of export technology levels, including low tech, medium tech, high tech, primary, and resource-based. The export share of low- and medium-technology, resource-based products did not change significantly during this period. However, the proportion of primary products has declined markedly, mainly due to a decline in crude oil export and export control policy to limit minerals and raw material export. At the same time, the share of high-technology products export increased sharply, a trend closely associated with huge investment projects of some leading multinationals\u2014including Samsung Group and Intel Corporation\u2014which selected Vietnam as a production base for mobile phone and tablet products for export worldwide.

In devising a connectivity strategy to continue supporting such trends, one might want to ask: \u2022 Which specific sectors or value chains require the most attention? \u2022 Are some value chains more dependent on transport and logistics connectivity than others? \u2022 Which corridors will become critical as Vietnam aspires to improve its trade competitiveness?

Samsung Vina turned into a 100 percent FDI company after Samsung bought back all shares from its partner in 2013. In 2009, Samsung made a big move with a new project in Bac Ninh producing smartphones, with the total investment of US$670 million. Since then, Samsung has been expanding production, opening six new factories in Vietnam\u2014in Bac Ninh, Thai Nguyen, and Ho Chi Minh City provinces, along with a research and development center in Hanoi\u2014with a total of US$17 billion in registered investment capital. A decade after starting the first smartphone project, Samsung has cultivated its Vietnam supply chain with 29 suppliers\u2014up from four in 2014\u2014and is expected to expand to 50 by 2020. Although the local supply chain has expanded, Samsung still relies on imported parts delivered mostly from China through the Huu Nghi land border gate, or from other countries via Dinh Vu seaport, and most importantly from Noi Bai airport. Samsung Vietnam makes the majority of its global smartphones output in Vietnam, including its latest flagship device, exported globally via Noi Bai airport. This is one of main reasons Samsung\u2019s share of smartphone export has increased significantly over the past decade to one-fifth of Vietnam\u2019s total exports. Samsung\u2019s share of trade value via air gateways has also increased rapidly, from 15.6 percent in 2011 to 39.5 percent in 2016. Samsung Vietnam has developed a unique supply chain and logistics system to ensure the shortest delivery time for its just-in-time production in Vietnam.

A value chain\u2019s connective propensity is analyzed based on locational distribution of its segments and linkages, as well as its interaction with the transport network. Traffic is assumed to flow on the lowest cost paths between the key locations along each segment of a value chain, from the inputs, production and processing, and end consumers, which in the case of an export-dominant sector are located at key international gateways. Figure 2.7 presents the results of transport mapping for aquaculture. By repeating the same analysis for all nine value chains, which combined account for more than 70 percent of total export, the export value-chain critical transport corridors are identified, as shown in figure 2.8. The thickness of a transport link represents the number of value chain linkages relying on it and highlights the parts of the network crucial to support not just movement of final export products, but also the backward input linkages connecting them.

Nevertheless, the recent trends and feedback from various industry stakeholders can point us to key challenges and directions for future development. While Vietnam operates 48 border gates in 31 provinces, trade flows are concentrated in only a handful of border gates. As briefly discussed in chapter 1, the top 12 border gates, two airports, five seaports and five land border-crossing points handled more than 91 percent of total trade in value in 2016 (see figure 1.2 and figure 1.3). Furthermore, the six most significant gateways, consisting of HCMC seaport complex, Haiphong seaport complex, Vung Tau seaport complex, Lang Son (land port on the Chinese border), Noi Bai airport (Hanoi), and Tan Son Nhat airport (HCMC) accounted for 81 percent of total trade (figure 2.9).

The rapid increase in flows through air gateways compared to other types of gateways coincides with a strong growth of production, export, and import of smaller volumes of higher value goods, such as mobile phones, electronic components, high fashion export, and high- value processed agricultural products. This shift is primarily due to Vietnam\u2019s deepened participation in GVC and significant influx of FDI, strategically located nearby these airports. As a result, air cargos in Vietnam are now dominated by electronics and electrical equipment\u2014which rose from 52.3 percent of total air cargo in 2011 to 75.9 percent in 2016 (see table 2.1). A handful of FDIs are responsible for these trends and cargo composition. The composition of exports and imports at both airports and seaports is changing, though not drastically. As presented in table 2.1 and table 2.2, between 2011 and 2016, the lists of most imported and exported products through airports and seaports remain largely unchanged except for a few products.

        "text": "the General Department of Vietnam Customs. TABLE 2.2. Import and Export Products through Vietnam Seaports Key gateways face three-pronged challenges: capacity constraints at major gateways, connectivity constraints to the transport network, and demand-supply mismatch. Each is explored in detail below. The rapid increase in cargo handled through major airports\u2014at 10.8 percent per year during 2009\u201317 (in terms of value)\u2014poses an increasing pressure on airport capacity, with respect to their runways, terminals, and affiliated logistics facilities. Industry stakeholders, including the logistics service sector, shippers, and cargo owners often raise their concerns of aggravating congestion at Vietnam\u2019s airports, especially at Tan Son Nhat airport in HCMC. In fact, the Government of Vietnam has long recognized this issue and has allocated significant funding for capacity expansion and efficiency improvements in major airports as well as construction of new airports, notably the planned development of Long Thanh airport in an eastern suburb of HCMC. Given the time-sensitivity involved with handling high-value air cargos, sufficient capacity\u2014both physical and operational\u2014would be essential to meet the growing demand resulting from the Vietnam\u2019s evolving global value chains. Hinterland connectivity around major gateways, particularly road connections to and from major ports, is also limited. Assessment of travel speed data from various sources, including from the commercial vehicle tracking system (CVTS) data provided by the Directorate for Roads of Vietnam 41 Chapter 2: Integrating with Global Markets(DRVN), shows the impacts of traffic congestion in the transport network around major gateways (see the section titled \u201cChallenges and Opportunities for Logistics Services\u201d in chapter 3 for further details). Congestion is particularly severe around HCMC\u2019s Tan Son Nhat airport and the HCMC seaport complex (including Cat Lai port), the two major facilities located closest to high-density urban areas. On the major connecting roads around these facilities, heavy truck traffic and urban commuter traffic"

Given the conflicting interests between heavy truck traffic and urban commuters, such measures do not offer a sustainable solution. A more comprehensive congestion mitigating solution could include development of various logistics facilities such as urban distribution centers, warehousing, and development of public transport systems for commuters currently relying on private transport modes. Similar challenges apply to intermodal connectivity around Vietnam\u2019s inland waterway transport, which forms an integral part of trade corridors. Many of Vietnam\u2019s river ports and terminals along Vietnam\u2019s extensive inland navigation system are poorly connected to the main road or rail network. Moreover, many seaports lack capacity to efficiently handle transshipment to and from inland waterway vessels, creating capacity bottlenecks and increasing transport costs. For instance, some ports in Vung Tau seaport complex were built with limited berth capacity for handling IWT vessels, as at the time, planners anticipated that most traffic would come through land via the road network. When the ports started operation in 2011, however\u2014partly due to the delayed construction of the connecting roads and partly to the lower transport costs on IWT compared to roads\u2014much more cargo arrived by barges than by trucks. This created unexpected, yet serious capacity chokepoints for container cargo handling, which were later relieved through construction of additional port berths for IWT vessels.5 Obvious imbalance exists between demand and supply at Vietnam\u2019s various seaports. Operating at or near capacity, the two historically important seaports\u2014HCMC seaport complex and Haiphong seaport complex\u2014continue to handle most of Vietnam\u2019s trade volume. Meanwhile, the newer development in Vung Tau seaport complex is operating much below the designed capacity; some of the container terminals, especially those in the inner coast where the water is"

Nevertheless, signs point to these deep-sea ports gaining competitiveness through their natural advantages (for example, water depth) and continued efforts to improve service and lower prices, as shown in table 2.3.

Given these dynamics, in addressing the demand-supply mismatch, Vietnam\u2019s gateway strategy should be driven by a network perspective, not by the perspective of individual ports and airports. While the seaports currently dominating the market have demonstrated they can provide highly efficient services to their customers (as seen by the strong market inertia), they also have limited room to expand capacity. Moreover, Vietnam could potentially realize a significant gain by having a vibrant transshipment facility able to call large vessels with intercontinental capacity. With increasing trade and container volumes, direct intercontinental shipment could significantly reduce transit time. For instance, the transit time from the Haiphong International Container Terminal at Lach Huyen\u2014if ships go through transshipment ports such as Hong Kong SAR, China or Singapore\u2014would be 32 to 35 days to the east coast of the United States, and 28 to 30 days to Europe. Calling an intercontinental mother ship into Lach Huyen would reduce the transit time by around five days, to approximately 27 to 30 days to the east coast of the United States, and 23 to 25 days to Europe.7 Currently, every week the Vung Tau seaport complex operates around 13 direct services to the United States and two to Europe. Industry stakeholders predict that with continued good services and connectivity, these ports have the potential to further increase operations. A shift toward deep-sea, international transshipment facilities would go hand-in-hand with cargo consolidation for export and import, which may require redefining the roles of Vietnam\u2019s smaller ports to focus more on domestic coastal shipping to and from these international terminals. Such an arrangement, resembling a \u201chub-and-spoke\u201d structure, would mean a need to further develop domestic shipping routes, to provide a more vibrant role to smaller ports in moving cargos by sea to key coastal cities in Vietnam, rather"

Selected Statistics on Vietnam\u2019s Industrial Parks, 2018 Economic Clusters and Corridor Development Ample empirical evidence suggests that agglomeration and clustering in space enhances productivity and economic efficiency. The spatial economy of Vietnam has major concentrations of economic activity in its two economic centers, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, which collectively account for more than 60 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Industrial parks, the most prevalent instrument for manufacturing and industrial growth in Vietnam,8 are also concentrated around these two cities. This section seeks to understand how economic clustering relates to trade and transport connectivity and how Vietnam can reap the benefits of agglomeration for its future trade competitiveness. Particularly, we explore the relationship between the placement of industrial parks and the following four elements of connectivity: (a) to transport corridors, (b) to labor markets (urban centers), (c) to other industrial clusters, and (d) to international gateways. In order to obtain granular insights, we based the analysis on zones located in the northern part of Vietnam, and especially in the Red River Delta. Industrial and processing zones, also known as industrial parks, specialize in manufacturing of industrial products and supporting services. Occupying defined geographical areas, the total number of industrial parks (IPs) has increased from 264 in 2010, with 75 percent in operation, to 376 in 2018, with around 86 percent operational (table 2.4). In total, some 499 industrial parks have been designated in nearly all provinces, though they are unevenly distributed. Among these parks, only a few high-tech enterprises have been established to support scientific and technology research and training. In"

The majority of the IPs are concentrated around the national highway no. 5 (NH5) corridor, which had existed when the first IPs started to locate in the early 1990s.

While no concrete data is available to test the causes, increasing congestion along the NH5 necessitated the planning and construction of the expressway\u2014which since launching in 2015 has reduced the travel time between the two cities by about two hours. Perhaps not coincidentally, rising congestion and the halt in further investments into new IPs along this corridor share a common cause for agglomeration reaching a saturation point, thereby prohibiting any additional development. The below provides IP characteristics in the northern part of the country. As expected, industrial parks are located in proximity to major transport corridors; however, due to the endogeneity, it is impossible to establish the causal relationship between them. As shown in figure 2.13, over 50 percent of the industrial parks are located within one kilometer (line of sight) from the nearest transport corridor and almost 80 percent are located within two kilometers. Over time these industrial parks have attracted significant investments into their operation, first driven by foreign investors, but later (from 2003 on) more strongly by domestic investors, as depicted in figure 2.14. Industrial parks are closely located with one another, suggesting gains stemming from agglomeration.9 The distance to other industrial parks has consistently decreased over time as new parks were built in proximity to existing parks. Figure 2.14 shows the average and minimum distances of industrial parks established within a five-year period to all earlier-established parks. Clearly, the proximity has decreased sharply, from 126 km in 1995 (with only two operational IZs) to around 1 km in 2009, with more than 58 operational parks.

Most of the industrial parks are located near Hanoi or Haiphong, two of the big urban centers in northern Vietnam. Cities also offer access to research and development networks and other forms of knowledge sharing that can benefit the industrial parks. However, industrial parks are not necessarily located as closely to the nearest ports or airports as they are to transport corridors and cities; in fact, most IPs are located approximately 150 to 175 km from Haiphong port. This suggests that longer distances to port could be compensated by connectivity to labor supply and various inputs, access to other infrastructures, and generally good connectivity to more distant locations.

Distance of Industrial Parks to Various Locations 47 Chapter 2: Integrating with Global MarketsMoreover, land-based border crossing points to neighboring countries seem not to attract conventional industrial parks, with most IPs located relatively far from border points. However, after Vietnam created dedicated border economic zones near the border-crossing points, firms that specifically benefit from the proximity to border-crossing points have moved operations to these specialized industrial zones. These patterns reflect the influence of other variables, including the availability and price of land as well as the location decisions of individual provinces. The analysis shows no direct correlation between the size of industrial parks and their locations. In addition, parks are neither larger or smaller if closer to cities, gateways, or the corridor. Industrial park employment is also not affected by the location to urban centers or the proximity to other industrial parks. Subject to provincial planning processes and land availability, industrial park size is likely influenced by factors outside this analysis. Lastly, the importance of regional connectivity to trading gateways is expected to grow with Vietnam integrating in large trading networks such as the Belt and Road Initiative. The seaport complex of Hai Phong, part of the maritime silk route system, will play a major role, which might increase the importance of Haiphong and Hanoi as well as the industrial parks catering to export- oriented businesses. Based on the above known characteristics of IPs and the agglomeration history of IPs along the NH5 corridor, we hypothesize that investments in major interurban corridors provide new opportunity for economic clustering. This hypothesis is founded on the understanding that economic distance\u2014not physical distance\u2014determines"

Before the expressways were built, Vietnam\u2019s national highway system provided interrupted connections (that is, connections intersecting with local roads at grade) through urban areas. Even without factoring in congestion, the average travel speed hovered around 30 km per hour, and even lower for heavy duty vehicles. The slow travel speed increased the need for businesses to locate as closely to NH5 as possible, to shorten the economic distance to the major port and urban areas. However, development of expressways or other comparable major interurban connectivity infrastructure changes this equation. Now, with this infrastructure shortening the economic distance between points, firms can locate around a major junction well-connected with many useful locations. In other words, improved connectivity enlarges the potential land areas that might be considered suitable for economic clustering. See box 2.2 for an example of successful air and road hub connectivity in Memphis, Tennessee. Due to a lack of integration between the process for developing economic clusters and that for developing transport, such consideration is not yet formally reflected in the existing planning and investment mechanisms in Vietnam, primarily due to the surrounding institutional structure. After the national government sets the target number of parks to develop, provinces screen, appraise, select, and implement their own industrial parks, providing supportive local infrastructure such as electricity and water supply. Yet, the nationally important interurban transport infrastructure conceived and delivered by the Ministry of Transport is not always informed by comprehensive province- level planning information regarding economic clustering. Conversely, the construction of high-speed, high-capacity corridors creates new well-connected transport nodes; however, land use surrounding these high-value nodes for economic clustering, logistics services, or other purposes that maximize the connectivity benefits requires adequate support by land-use plan and policy to encourage such investments, which in turn"

These trends have been strongly and positively correlated with both economic growth and poverty reduction in Vietnam. \u2022 Vietnam holds comparative advantages over export in several sectors\u2014textile and garments, leather and footwear, electronics, wood products, rice, aquaculture, coffee, rubber, and vegetables and fruits\u2014which collectively account for over 70 percent of Vietnam\u2019s total exports. \u2022 Value chains in the nine sectors\u2014with backward linkages from inputs, production, and main export gateways\u2014have been constructed. In addition, transport links along which the value chains are moved have been identified using input\u2013output tables and various other statistics. \u2022 These value chains and transport links have helped create a map of \u201cvalue-chain critical\u201d transport corridors, on which trade competitiveness of the nine sectors would depend. \u2022 Vietnam\u2019s international trade is predominantly handled at a handful of key airports, seaports, and border-crossing points. With the rapid increase in air cargos, many stakeholders are growing increasingly concerned with the airports\u2019 physical and operational capacities. \u2022 Two historically dominant seaports\u2014in Ho Chi Minh City and Haiphong\u2014currently operate at near capacity, with connecting roads plagued with burgeoning congestion. \u2022 At the same time, the relatively new deep-sea ports in Vung Tau seaport complex and Lach Huyen present opportunities to further consolidate cargo and attract large intercontinental vessels, thus lowering transport costs and transit time.

Their success, measured in terms of investments attracted and employment generated, is affected by connectivity and several other factors. \u2022 As Vietnam develops major high-capacity, high-speed transport networks, such as the North\u2013 South Expressway, and thereby shortens economic distances across the country, broader areas become potential candidates for future economic clusters. At the same time, the areas with already developed clusters might be too congested or too expensive to attract new investment. \u2022 Future investments in major connective infrastructure should therefore closely coordinate with land-use plans to encourage development of surrounding high-value transport nodes for high productivity activities. \u2022 In particular, industrial parks and special economic zones require a comprehensive infrastructure planning since they act as nuclei for future clusters and urban growth. A sound infrastructure environment is crucial to reducing congesting and thus attracting more investments. 50 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityNOTES 1.

Jaffee, Brian G. Mtonya, and Yin Yin Lam The Vietnamese population is growing richer and more urban. The \u201cconsumer class,\u201d which consumes US$5.50 or more per person per day, is rapidly expanding from about 49 percent in 2010 to over 70 percent in 2016. About 89 percent of urban dwellers belong to the consumer class, compared to around 66 percent of the rural population. This emerging group consumes more, and more diverse, traded goods and services than its poorer counterparts. Such changes in consumption patterns, caused by a sharp rise of incomes, mean changes in what is moved where, how, and at what costs. This chapter identifies the key drivers shaping the present and future connectivity needs of emerging consumers and discusses how such needs can be addressed to better integrate domestic markets in Vietnam. 53 Chapter 3: Integrating Domestic MarketsRising Urban Middle-Class Consumers of Vietnam Following international norms,1 Vietnamese households are grouped into five economic classes based on their daily consumption per capita in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars: \u2022 the extremely poor, who live on less than US$1.90 per day \u2022 the moderately poor, whose per capita consumption ranges from US$1.90 to US$3.20 per day \u2022 the economically vulnerable, who consume US$3.20 to US$5.50 per person per day \u2022 the economically secure, consuming US$5.50 to US$15 per"

Vietnam\u2019s consumer class is growing rapidly. The share of households classified as economically secure increased from less than 50 percent in 2010 to 70 percent in 2016.

Beyond the physical connectedness, the changing patterns mean greater demand for sophisticated transport and logistics services, such as traceability, safety, timeliness, and quality. Two defining trends that lead to new connectivity challenges\u2014changing food consumption and emergence of e-commerce\u2014are also interrelated. Income growth and demographic changes have resulted in major shifts in dietary and food expenditure patterns.2 According to the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS), among Vietnam\u2019s urban population, the share of food expenditure for rice has fallen from 25 percent in 2002 to less than 10 percent in 2016. For this population, animal products (meat, eggs, and fish) now account for the largest share of food expenditure\u2014reaching over 38 percent in 2016. These shifts have not been limited to the middle- or upper-income segments of the urban population. In 2002, Q1 households spent 48 percent of their food budgets on rice versus 27 percent for meat and fish. By 2016, rice accounted for only 14 percent of their food spending, while meat and fish accounted for 39 percent. The above trends are supported by a survey conducted by University of Adelaide in 2016\u201317 of 2,000 urban households in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), and two provincial cities. These survey results, depicted in figure 3.2, show even higher share of meat (and eggs) in the provincial cities than in the large national cities. As shown below, more than 60 percent of food expenditures are for fresh perishable foods across all income groups in HCMC and Hanoi and is probably closer to 70 percent once the composition of foods consumed away from home is taken into account. As incomes rise, food expenditures per person see an absolute increase due to what is commonly referred to as \u201cdietary upgrading,\u201d which in Vietnam involves"

Later in the chapter, we examine these increasing e-commerce demands by this consumer class and their implication on connectivity. Challenges and Opportunities around Perishable Foods for the Cities After successfully overcoming food insecurity challenges over the past decades, Vietnam faces a new set of complex, inter-related food problems relate to the supply, distribution, and quality assurance for fresh perishable foods. In urban Vietnam, income gains have resulted in dietary shifts beyond rice on such a magnitude that these fresh foods now account for two-thirds of consumer food expenditures (figure 3.2), nearly double their share in the early 2000s. While much of this consumption and expenditure growth in fresh produce in urban areas has been serviced by Vietnamese farmers and market intermediaries, imports, especially of higher quality or different varieties of produce, have also surged in recent years. This new market presents enormous opportunities for Vietnamese farmers and food business operators, but only if they can meet consumer expectations for quality and safety, mobilize and deliver the products on a timely, reliable and cost competitive basis, and do so with limited negative impact on the environment (World Bank 2016a; Zorya and others 2018). The sourcing, urban distribution, and quality assurance of fresh perishable foods represent a comparatively new set of connectivity issues"

Primary production, aggregation, and subsequent distribution remain highly fragmented and only a small proportion of marketed output can be traced to its origins. This presents a problem given the multifaceted risk profile of many perishable foods. As a result, much of the delivery system servicing Vietnam\u2019s major cities for fresh perishable foods experiences very high levels of physical and product quality losses, frequently provides consumers with produce contaminated by chemical or microbiological hazards, and generates negative environmental impacts. Each of these dimensions entail large economic costs for cities, their residents, and their rural hinterlands. While the number of \u201cmodern retail\u201d outlets has grown rapidly in Vietnam\u2019s urban areas, their market share remains insignificant compared to their traditional counterparts.

For urban consumers, conveniently located wet markets and informal street markets offer a wide range of (generally very fresh) fruits, vegetables, and animal products, flexible packaging sizes, and negotiable prices. Most shoppers walk to these venues or carry small loads on bicycles or motorbikes. Traditional vendors have very low rental and operational costs, which help them keep prices low. On the other hand, shopping at modern markets often requires more time and distance. Only a small proportion of mostly higher income urban residents, who self-claim to be conscious about quality and food safety, regularly purchase fresh produce in supermarkets, where produce tends to be less diverse and less fresh, yet often more expensive than in the traditional outlets.

It also involves effective farm-to-market information flows pertaining to the product as well as its origins, quality characteristics, biosecurity status, and its production processes. Multiple functions must be undertaken and relationships developed to regularize or institutionalize all of this. In fact, a well-connected, well-performing market system"

Vietnam\u2019s cold-chain market has grown rapidly in recent years to reach an estimated market size of US$169 million (FiinGroup 2019). However, most cold storage operations serve the export market; while cold transportation segment is rapidly growing, the market is highly fragmented with many small players who have limited financial capabilities. While Vietnam has implemented a vast set of laws, regulations, and guidelines around the market chain for perishable foods, enforcement gaps persist. Multiple ministries and levels of government have been designated to handle or share the mandates to induce, prohibit, or constrain various types of practices and behavior across all stages and players in the farm-to-market chain for perishable foods.3 Despite the presence of this regulatory framework, the main challenge relates to enforcement or the lack of effective incentives to induce widespread voluntary compliance with regulations. With its highly fragmented structure of food production, intermediation, and distribution, full regulatory oversight is impossible given the current human and financial resources available to government. And, in many ways, broad regulatory enforcement has not been an operative objective in Vietnam\u2019s agro-food system.

The consequences of poor connectivity and practices A growing body of evidence points to inefficiencies in domestic value chains for perishable foods as well as serious problems related to food safety and environmental management. This translates into significant economic and social costs and in low levels of consumer confidence and satisfaction. The latter, if not effectively addressed, could weaken the competitiveness of Vietnamese farms and food enterprises in the longer term. Some of this evidence is highlighted here. For example: 60 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityFirst, physical food loss throughout the food chain is significant due to fragmented distribution systems, including the lack of cold storage or refrigerated transport services. A 2018 survey of 150 farmers and enterprises who are prominent suppliers of fresh produce to the HCMC market shows estimated physical product losses of nearly 25 percent, including 32 percent for fruit and vegetables, 14 percent for meat, and 12 percent for fish, only until intermediate distribution points. Estimated losses could be far greater if totals included those incurred during the food processing and final retail distribution phases. Very little use of cold storage or refrigerated transport services occurs in the domestic market, especially the market servicing the traditional distribution channels.4 If these rates of product loss represent the national picture, then total national losses of such high-value perishable foods would amount to nearly US$3.9 billion, equivalent to 12 percent of Vietnam\u2019s agricultural GDP and 2 percent of its total GDP. Second, the supply chain for perishable foods is generating enormous amounts of food and other organic waste; much of this waste is mismanaged which results in significant environmental consequences and high economic costs. In urban Vietnam few active programs exist to"

In HCMC, for example, only about 10 percent of food waste, more than 80 percent of the volume of HCMC\u2019s landfill, is collected and converted into compost; none is converted to industrial uses or bioenergy (Ngoc, Nguyen, and Ngoc 2018). The three wholesale markets in HCMC spend more than US$100,000 per month dealing with garbage or treating waste. Food waste often ends up in canals, ponds, and other surface waters, clogging waterway traffic and contaminating water used for drinking, recreation, or fishing. Thus, instead of being mobilized as a valuable resource, organic waste imposes large environmental and economic costs. Third, mixing cities and animals has translated into a biosecurity risk. A long-standing preference for purchasing \u201cwarm\u201d meat has resulted in large movements of live animals to Vietnamese cities and their slaughter in close vicinity to residential areas. Each day, some 150,000 chickens are moved, sold, and slaughtered in both Hanoi and HCMC. On an annual basis this translates into 55 million chickens. Many of these are channeled through live bird markets, which are typically responsible for transmission of avian influenza that threatens public health (Fournie and others 2012). City food systems and food waste are also likely playing a significant role in the spread of African Swine Fever (for which no known controls exist) and which results in 100 percent mortality for affected pigs. ASF can be spread not only by infected animals, but also through raw meat transported from place to place, converted into feed scraps, or found in organic waste. Fourth, marketed perishable foods have high rates of microbiological and chemical contamination, with the most serious issues related to meat. For example, in a recent study, Nguyen"

The Salmonella prevalence rate was higher in wet markets (90 percent) than in supermarkets (53 percent). Ministry of Health statistics indicate that over the 2011 to 2016 period, seven foodborne diseases impacted an average of 669,000 people per year (National Assembly 2017). Other estimates, taking into account a broader range of foodborne diseases, suggest that more than 61 Chapter 3: Integrating Domestic Marketsten times this number of Vietnamese citizens are sickened (and 3,500 people die) each year from unsafe food. In fact, the proportional incidence of foodborne illness per 100,000 people is higher in Vietnam than in any other country in Asia.5 The public health burden of foodborne disease in Vietnam is now on par with that of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDs. Jaffee and others (2019) estimate that Vietnam\u2019s annual productivity loss (due to loss of work, disability, and premature death) from foodborne disease amounts to some US$740 million per year. The medical costs of treating foodborne illness in Vietnam likely exceed US$200 million per year. Given the above, not surprisingly, Vietnamese consumers rate food safety as their number one social concern. A growing number of recent surveys have sought to gauge consumer attitudes and concerns about food. While some surveys reveal concerns about matters of nutrition and dietary quality, by far the strongest and most widespread concerns pertain to food safety. Remarkably, the lack of trust in the local food safety is almost universal. A 2018 survey conducted in multiple Vietnamese cities found 89 percent of respondents characterizing local food as \u201cunsafe,\u201d echoing a 2016 survey that found middle- and upper-income consumers in Hanoi to either be worried (30 percent) or"

An April 2019 survey of social concerns among Hanoi and HCMC households ranked food safety as the number one concern, far outpacing issues of pollution, access to social services and education, and other issues. Vietnam is likely the only country in the world where such a large number of citizens rank food safety the number one social concern. The above economic, environmental, and public health issues associated with food safety are likely to continue to increase over time, along with further dietary changes toward intrinsically more hazardous foods. Therefore, it is critical to overhaul the perishable food chains in all aspects, ranging from the regulatory framework and investments in market infrastructure, to transportation and logistics services and an enforcement system. Emergence of E-Commerce in Vietnam As is the rest of the world\u2019s economies, Vietnam\u2019s economy is heading toward the \u201cdigital economy,\u201d with its economic entities\u2014producers and consumers alike\u2014increasingly reliant on various digital technologies for information gathering, communication, transactions, and decision- making.

OECD defines e-commerce as the \u201csale or purchase of goods or services conducted over a computer network by methods specifically designed for the purpose of receiving or placing of orders,\u201d while WTO defines e-commerce as \u201cthe production, distribution, marketing, sale, or delivery of goods and services by electronic means.\u201d The digital technologies driving this transition toward the digital economy provide opportunities for growth and enhance inclusivity, by increasing productivity of firms, lowering costs of information and transactions, and lowering information barriers.

Projections show e-commerce in Southeast Asia, including in Vietnam, growing rapidly. According to one estimate, the e-commerce market in Southeast Asia is estimated to grow from US$23.2 billion (gross merchandise value) in 2018 to US$102 billion by 2025 (Google and Temasek 2018). The three largest e-commerce firms in the region\u2014Lazada, Shopee, and Tokopedia\u2014grew collectively between 2015 and 2018 by a factor of seven, while the next seven largest players grew by a factor of two during the same time. This rapid growth in e-commerce has been fueled by growing incomes, consumer demand and preferences, increased mobile penetration, and improving logistics networks. This growth is also expected to change the dynamics of competition and growth. E-commerce players are expected to expand from major cities such as Hanoi and HCMC to secondary cities such as Can Tho and rural areas with lower e-commerce penetration\u2014but higher growth potential\u2014making connectivity and logistics more important for sector growth going forward.

As noted in a recent World Bank report, the acceleration of Southeast Asian e-commerce has been facilitated by the surge of marketplaces where SMEs sell to consumers by providing scalable, readily-accessible platforms where smaller retail players and merchants can transact online and reach new consumers (World Bank forthcoming). Most e-commerce merchants in Vietnam are involved in food products, electronics, and clothing and footwear; a majority (58 percent) of e-commerce merchants sell and buy online, while 32 percent only sell online. A number of sectors participating in the Vietnam e-commerce ecosystem have uneven market conditions and levels of development. Facilitating a large number of small-size e-commerce firms to deliver goods and services in a timely, cost-efficient, and convenient manner to customers, requires a well-functioning e-commerce ecosystem made up of players in various interrelated sectors.

Freight consolidation could also potentially find work-arounds for seasonality, and other unavoidable factors contributing to empty backhauls and lighter truckloads during certain months of the year. Emerging Challenges and Opportunities for LSP Last-mile delivery is the final segment of the logistics chain where goods are transferred from the fulfillment center of the Business to Customer\u2019s (B2C) home or collection point. Timeliness, reliability, cost, and convenience in delivery are becoming increasingly important factors in last-mile delivery for e-commerce companies. The growth of e-commerce has led to a growing number of smaller parcels, leading to increasing logistics challenges. For urban deliveries, the challenges for urban logistics include traffic and congestion, truck access, and off-hour delivery. In contrast, cost, distance, and lack of facilities and infrastructure comprise the challenges of rural deliverables. While larger e-commerce firms can afford their own fleets (that is, 1PL), most e-commerce firms use a combination of 1PL, 2PL, and 3PL\u2014and in limited cases\u20144PL. Postal services are adapting to the rise of e-commerce and companies such as Vietnam Post and Viettel Post are taking advantage of these new opportunities to increase revenue. A specific challenge for postal services and other last-mile delivering companies is whether parcels can be delivered or picked up at home addresses.

Challenges of urban logistics8 With the rapid growth of cities such as HCMC and Hanoi, we must study the challenges around urban logistics\u2014which often involve trips under 100 km\u2014and the opportunities therein for improving operational efficiency and links with intercity freight movement. Companies involved in urban trucking are often the first- and last-mile delivery partners of intercity transportation companies. Some of the shorter trips (under 100 km) include the \u201cdrayage\u201d of intermodal (or ISO) containers between a maritime or river port and its immediate urban and industrial hinterland.

Therefore, urban trucking companies face high levels of passenger traffic when running logistics services within the city, with over 70 percent of the road users riding mopeds. In addition, car ownership is also expected to rise, due to increasing disposable incomes. Together, the passenger and cargo traffic lead to high levels of congestion in the city. Government studies calculate that traffic jams in Hanoi cause VND 12.6 trillion (US$600 million) in economic losses every year (Saigoneer 2017). Analysis of the Directorate for Roads of Vietnam\u2019s (DRVN) commercial vehicle tracking system, or CVTS, show high congestion patches, particularly in the city center (figure 3.13). Hanoi also acts as a transit stop for importers and exporters operating out of the Haiphong port. Hanoi offers office space, and many logistics companies and distributors have opened offices and warehouses in the city center. Goods from Haiphong port are brought to the Hanoi-based warehouses and then dispatched throughout Vietnam, adding to the city\u2019s traffic congestion. However, building warehouses and consolidation centers near Haiphong port or in the city\u2019s outskirts would prevent this import\u2013export traffic from moving into and out of the city, thus reducing congestion. Another major source of cargo traffic derives from the logistics operations of e-commerce companies as well as the daily deliveries of restaurants, grocery stores, and other small enterprises. Interviews with logistics companies indicate inefficient intra-city road structures, insufficient overpasses, underpasses, and bridges, which all lead to high congestion levels. In such circumstances, city planning and zoning take on a greater importance, clarifying the need for the clear demarcation of commercial, industrial, and residential zones. Residential neighborhoods around industrial areas create challenges surrounding the combination of cargo and passenger traffic. FIGURE 3.13.

Cargo truck movement in the city is only allowed during off-peak hours from 9:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m., which reduces peak-hour traffic congestion. However, the restricted timings also lead to congestion at city entry points during the restricted hours. Urban consolidation centers (UCCs) located at the city fringes serve as potential sites for freight consolidation for goods moving out of the city as well as freight deconsolidation into smaller trucks for goods moving into the city. In addition, UCCs could provide organized parking spaces for the larger trucks during restricted hours. Case study 2: Ho Chi Minh City HCMC is one of the densest cities in Vietnam, with approximately 4,000 people per sq. km of area. The CVTS data analysis of the province shows high congestion in the central city (see figure 3.14). Factors attracting industries include the geographical advantages of HCMC with seaports and river ports and the availability of good quality human resources. While the population growth rate is a modest 1.46 percent, the migration rate is relatively high, at 3.8 percent per year. Because HCMC is an economic hub for Vietnam, a huge number of vehicle users come to the city, piling pressure onto the traffic infrastructure. Due to the presence of rivers, the region is also prone to seasonal flooding, which further adds to the city\u2019s traffic challenges. A unique feature of HCMC\u2014which distinguishes its traffic management from Hanoi\u2014is the proximity of both Ho Chi Minh seaport complex and Tan Son Nhat airport to the city center"

The HCMC seaport complex is one of the most important ports for export and import in the country and serves as the main gateway for the region, accounting for 67 percent of the total throughput of all ports in Vietnam. Trucks used for the first- or last-mile delivery of containers and bulk goods from city ports into city centers contribute to the high levels of congestion. FIGURE 3.14.

Consequently, these port access roads could benefit from additional lanes dedicated to moving cargo traffic. Further, the Cai Mep\u2013Thi Via port, an underutilized deep-water port located around 80 km south of HCMC, can handle more throughput from the Ho Chi Minh port. Truck traffic in HCMC is also subject to timing restrictions. Laws recently put in place by the HCMC People\u2019s Committee restrict light trucks from entering the city\u2019s urban area during peak hours from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. In addition, heavy trucks and container trucks are not allowed in urban areas from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. As discussed in the Hanoi case study, UCCs could potentially offer organized space for parking trucks and consolidating freight during restricted hours.

Cities have daunting challenges of ensuring their citizens meet their daily mobility needs\u2014such as commuting and other trips\u2014while at the same time enabling goods movement for businesses and households, especially in light of increasing e-commerce. These issues are not easy to solve or inexpensive as regulations alone would not be sufficient to resolve them. Solutions would likely require significant investments in urban infrastructure including for public transport systems, relocation, new development or capacity expansion of various cargo handling facilities as well as less capital-intensive investments such as traffic management and regulations.

And thus, the food supply chains around the largest cities of Vietnam continue to rely on traditional wet markets and fragmented logistics chains, which lack the ability ensure necessary conditions for freshness and safety of fresh food. \u2022 As a result, Vietnam\u2019s cities and their residents face some serious challenges, including massive loss of food during the supply chain, endemic issues around food safety due to various forms of contamination occurring throughout the supply chain, and a wide range of environmental pollution caused by unhygienic slaughtering practices in close proximity with urban density. \u2022 Tackling such"

However, with the sector still at an early stage of growth and dominated by SMEs, creating an enabling environment is necessary. \u2022 Along with its potential benefits, e-commerce also brings additional challenges, such as growing needs for new types of logistics services, involving door-to-door connectivity, last- mile delivery, and urban storages able to meet the demand yet provide proximity. All of these issues bring further challenges in Vietnam\u2019s fast-growing, congested cities, which also need to address conflicting urban mobility issues concerning daily commuters. \u2022 Domestic air freight is growing rapidly due to income rises and emergence of e-commerce. While the current volumes are sufficiently handled in passenger plane cargo holds, this might not be sustainable in the long-term as volumes are rising, and seasonality of freight demand is not consistent with passenger demand. The limited cargo handling capacities at most domestic airports could also pose challenges for sector growth. \u2022 Urban logistics in Vietnam\u2019s already built-up and congested large cities pose serious challenges to various stakeholders with conflicting needs.

MARD enforces rules related to the sale and use of agricultural inputs and shares with MoNRE oversight on how water and land is allocated and used. The operative Food Law designates different responsibilities for food safety oversight to MARD, Ministry of Health (MoH), and Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT), with distinctions across product lines and food system players. The MoT and municipal governments oversee regulations regarding the types of vehicles which may be used for transporting food and animals and restrictions on time or locations for vehicular movements. 4. Cold-chain warehousing capacity is estimated to have quadrupled over the past ten years, reaching approximately 450,000 pallets in 2017, with an estimated 20 professional cold storage providers in southern Vietnam and 40 in the north. Much of this storage is used for external trade, the pharmaceutical industry, and by supermarkets. Comparatively, much less investment has gone into refrigerated vehicles due to concerns about road quality, cost, intermittent use, ability to withstand high external temperatures, and lack of understanding of its full benefits (see Walsh 2018). 5. The best available estimates probably come from the work of the WHO-convened Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG). Its findings were reported on a subregional rather than country-specific level. See Havelaar and others 2015. 6.

However, physical connection alone is not sufficient for reducing economic distance, as the connection must also link to areas that provide economic opportunities with sufficient economic density. This chapter examines how economic opportunities are spatially distributed in Vietnam, how different parts of the country are connected to these economic opportunities, and how and to what extent connectivity has affected their economic well-being. 79 Chapter 4: Delivering on \u201cLast-Mile\u201d Inclusion Spatial Variation of Economic Densities and Outcomes in Vietnam As urbanization and agglomeration continues, the already uneven distribution of population and economic activities in Vietnam is becoming more uneven. Vietnam is characterized by very low-density areas in the northern mountains and central highlands bordering Lao PDR and Cambodia as well as densely populated areas around Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and Hanoi (figure 4.1A). Economic activity measured in terms of estimated local GDP is even more concentrated than population in the communes of HCMC and Hanoi, as shown in figure 4.1B. The remaining activities spread along the coast and in the southern part of the country. Over the past decade, the most populated areas have grown the most in terms of population size, as a result of continued"

        "text": "from major urban centers. High mountain communes also have a significantly lower population density, at 34 people per square kilometer compared to 257 people per km2 in inland and delta communes. Thus, poverty is much higher in areas with the lowest economic density, presence of firms and access to non-farm wage jobs (table 4.1). Limited access to off-farm opportunities accounts for much of the cross-regional income differences, mirroring the spatial variation in the economic structure within the country. Average incomes are significantly lower in high mountain communes, especially in non-farm wages, household businesses, and remittances categories (figure 4.3). The combined income differential in household businesses and wage earnings alone almost explains the differences in income between high mountain and inland-delta communes. These differences are not only a result of limited participation in off-farm wage jobs, but also due to the much lower average wage earnings in remote areas, reflecting the low-value addition and opportunities in the lagging low and high mountain areas. Improved access to more productive off-farm opportunities is therefore key to closing Vietnam\u2019s spatial disparities in household incomes. In part, this requires overcoming the challenges of remoteness that characterize many of the lagging areas, making improved connectivity a central pillar for equalizing access to opportunities in Vietnam.TABLE 4.1.

See: https://www.gso.gov.vn/default_en.aspx?tabid=515 &ItemID=18977.Conceptual Link between Connectivity and Economic Outcomes At the macro level, uneven distribution of densities is a natural outcome of geography and economic agglomeration. Multiple factors explain the concentration of economic activities in some locations, including the geography of the country, the gains from agglomeration, the access to international gateways, and so on. While workers benefit from concentration through better access to jobs and amenities, and firms benefit from access to production services, consumers, and workers, such concentration also brings pollution, congestion, and higher land prices, which can in turn discourage or constrain further concentration. The relative strengths of the agglomeration and dispersion forces underlying these concentrations of economic activity are central to spatial disparity and other related economic issues. Firm location and investment decisions strongly correlate with economic density and connectivity, which in turn determine availability of wage jobs. Data from the 2016 economic census show fewer firms in remote areas. Two-thirds of communes without an enterprise in 2016 are located in mountainous areas. The smaller market means fewer opportunities for easy-to-start household enterprises, most of which concentrate in the retail and trade services sectors. An average of four service sector enterprises operate in communes with fewer than 10,000 people, compared to an average of"

The average firm is also smaller in less populated communes, averaging 16 workers per firm in communes with fewer than 10,000 people, and about 36 workers per firm in communes with between 30,000 and 40,000 people. Similarly, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Vietnam is largely concentrated in high density population areas (see figure 4.5). However, some less populated provinces with better market access due to good connectivity or proximity to international gateways (for example, China in the north) have become incipient recipients of FDI. As a result, far fewer wage jobs are available in remote areas (figure 4.6). Remoteness and low density contribute to the lack of economic opportunities in Vietnam\u2019s lagging areas. Structurally, the lagging areas of Vietnam\u2014further away from economic hubs, yet much more sparsely populated\u2014have low market access.

Examples in Vietnam include forestry products and ecotourism in the northern mountain regions. Second, with small local markets, growth in economic activities is driven by external demand, either domestic (from cities and other regions), and/or international, for example, in niche products and services or tourism. Third, growth is mostly delivered by small and medium enterprises (SMEs), since it is often difficult to achieve scale in low-density economies, except for single-firm localities dominated by one large firm that exploits the area\u2019s natural resources, as in the case of mining. Both low labor supply and low local demand due to small population size can limit scale in this case. Connectivity is key to both maximizing the benefits of agglomeration and overcoming the challenges of remoteness and low density by reducing economic distances between firms, people, and markets. Transport connectivity is central to understanding how people and firms locate across space and defines how regions can access other domestic and global markets. Better connectivity will reduce frictions hampering growth and improves access for lagging regions to the rest of the country and global markets. Given the above spatial distribution of people and economic activities in Vietnam, the transport network quality will matter in connecting the main growth poles, in connecting the secondary cities to these main growth poles, in connecting lagging regions to growing regions, and in connecting these regions to the main international gateways.

        "text": "low-density economies depend on improved connectivity to link them into the network economy, thus enlarging the external market crucial for generating growth in low-density economies. With better connectivity and market access, lagging areas could tap into regional and global value chains by attracting maturing industries seeking cost advantages beyond large urban centers. As agglomeration centers evolve into high-value products, some mature industries lose their competitiveness in large urban areas. They then seek to relocate to the periphery, with cheaper labor, rents, and other services. This provides an opportunity for growth in lagging areas, but one that would most likely benefit areas with better connectivity and market access. The shift of garment value chains and other low value-added manufacturing activities have also been biased toward outer provinces with much better access. Besides limiting job creation and thus labor demand, remoteness also creates stronger incentives for households to prioritize food subsistence over non-food production activities (Low 1986). Remote and therefore poorly integrated food markets create a price wedge. Isolated households tend to pay more for food from outside markets because of the high transaction costs. Thus, households in remote areas will have a strong incentive to produce food, at a lower cost, to meet their own consumption requirements. Conversely, any surplus they produce would fetch a low producer price because of the same high costs of marketing the crop outside the area. The result is a low-level subsistence equilibrium, biased toward food production. This affects household labor supply decisions at two levels: (a) crop choice when allocating land among different agriculture activities, and (b) participation rates in off-farm activities when allocating labor. Within agriculture, the price wedge would disincentivize a shift of production to higher-value non-cereal crops, even in areas more agronomically suitable for non-cereals crops.

Thus, low market access can be a limiting factor to off-farm participation by both reducing labor demand and off-farm labor supply. In addition to the impact of access to wage jobs, market access can also explain the variation in real wages across regions. In literature, the regional variation in wages has been attributed to (a) skills sorting, arguing that agglomeration centers attract better-skilled and better-paid workers, (b) increasing returns\u2014external to firms, due to spillovers between firms or human capital externalities, as agglomeration generates greater knowledge spillovers between firms and workers, therefore raising productivity and wages, and (c) non-human factor endowments (Combes, Duranton, and Gobillon 2008; Hanson 2003; Head and Mayer 2006). However, a growing body of literature appeals mainly to transport costs and increasing returns (Redding and Venables 2003; Redding and Venables 2004), arguing that market access accounts in part for the spatial variation in wages across regions. Firms in locations with greater market access face lower transportation costs, which increases their profitability and ability to pay higher wages while remaining competitive. Invoking this argument, Hering and Poncet (2010) finds market access explains a significant part of the interindividual difference in wages in China\u2014after controlling for skills, living costs, firm types, and provincial fixed effects accounting for other place-specific, non- human endowments present in agglomeration centers with higher market access. A large variation in wages is also evident in Vietnam (figure 4.7). Lagging provinces, with lower market access, have significantly lower average wages. Average wages are highest in densely populated areas around the Hanoi\u2013 Haiphong and HCMC economic corridors. Wages are substantially lower in less populated areas further off these"

Better connectivity results in cheaper access to consumers and producers in other districts and increases domestic trade (figure 4.10A). The districts that experienced the largest reductions in average domestic travel time saw the highest increase in trade with other districts. When consumers have access to more and cheaper goods from the rest of the country, producers can sell to more consumers. The connectivity improvement from 2009 to 2017 has slowed down the concentration rate of workers in the main two urban poles, benefiting more distant areas in the northwest and along the coastline. This happened because improvements to the transport network occurred in a relatively even fashion across the country, with significant investments made in some less-developed and lower- density areas. By reducing travel time and improving market access for some less-dense and less-rich areas, changes in the transport network brought large increases in real wages and attractiveness of these areas for workers. As a result, population growth in the districts around Hanoi and HCMC slowed to a lower growth rate. While better connectivity has increased real incomes for all districts, wages have grown faster in the Northwestern and Central Highlands districts of the country (figure 4.9B). While the creation of better opportunities in these districts has slowed down domestic migration toward the two main urban centers, migration to these centers remains the dominant form of rural-urban migration for the country (figure 4.9A). The overall effects on territorial development are mixed, however, leaving isolated areas that virtually lost out on the growth and dynamic centers that benefited.

Reducing transport costs on one segment affects locations directly on the segment as well as locations through which producers or consumers travel. Market access can be used to quantify the connectivity of districts to other domestic markets; therefore, transport investments will affect market access of all locations.

Accessibility has also improved greatly for communes along the coast line as well as along the major transport corridors where investments have been made. Changes in market access mostly result from changes in transport costs over the last decade. Access to markets depends both on transport costs and the size of the markets that can be reached.

Contrast this to provinces like Dien Bien which are poorly connected and have the lowest number of off-farm wage jobs\u2014at fewer than 15,000 per province. However, descriptive evidence alone is not conclusive due to the presence of confounding factors. Areas with low market access tend to coincide with those populated by an ethnic minority or with lower education attainment, which have been found as important factors (Hoang, Pham, and Uluba\u015fo\u011flu 2014; Newman and Kinghan 2015). Road infrastructure investments are also endogenous to economic potential across areas. A tendency to build roads in areas with high economic potential increases the likelihood of more job creation. The following analysis attempts to isolate and quantify the contributions of market access to household participation in non-agriculture employment activities in rural and peri-urban areas, controlling for the confounding factors. 93 Chapter 4: Delivering on \u201cLast-Mile\u201d InclusionThe result suggests that market access explains a considerable amount, but not all, of the variation in access to off-farm opportunities in lagging areas. Improved market access also mitigates the disadvantage of low population density. Even after controlling for other factors, the local population density accounts for a significant variation in the probability of holding off-farm wage employment. But households living in a low-density population area with market access have far better prospects for a higher-wage job. In high mountain communes for example, the probability of off-farm wage employment nearly doubles for both the lowest and middle densely populated communes as market access improves from less than one standard deviation below the mean, to within a standard deviation above the mean. In low mountain communes, a 48 percent (15 percentage points) increase is observed for the low-density population communes, but only"

This demographic advantage is lower when only comparing locations, meaning that while investment to improve market access can help close the gap in access to off-farm wage jobs between lagging regions and other places, complementary policies are needed to improve access to jobs for ethnic minorities within regions, allowing them to benefit despite their demographic advantage. 95 Chapter 4: Delivering on \u201cLast-Mile\u201d Inclusion Estimates suggest that improved market access can narrow the gender gap in wage job participation. The marginal effects of market access are significantly higher for spouses than for their husbands. In the joint allocation decision model, applied only to a subsample of couples, for example, comparison of the marginal effects of market access on non-farm wage jobs participation is nearly twice as large for spouses than for their husbands. Women in Vietnam are twice as likely to engage in unpaid family work than men, while both our estimates and those in recent literature (Dang, Hiraga, and Nguyen 2019) suggests that women in households with young children are less likely to engage in paid work. That market access can explain a higher variation of wage participation for married women than for their husbands suggests that improving market access helps women access paid jobs more, which in turn could help close the gender gaps in participation in paid work. The positive relationship between market access and wage job participation in Vietnam appears to be influenced more by the impact market access has on job access than by integration of food markets, as the price wedge hypothesis would predict. The price wedge hypothesis argues that due to poorly integrated food"

In fact, evidence in Vietnam suggests the opposite. We compared the share of net-rice buyers based on the number of household members engaged in off-farm work using the VHLSS 2016 data, which indicated the share of rice net-buyers is higher among households with many people engaged in non-farm work in remote highland communes. Similar results found with inland and delta communes (figure 4.15) contradict the notion that disintegrated food markets trap people in agriculture in remote areas. The pattern suggests the need to first meet subsistence needs does not constrain households from seeking off-farm employment. Rather, the low availability of opportunities serves as the limiting factor to household off-farm income generation.Source: World Bank calculations from the 2016 VHLSS, conducted by the GSO.

The pattern is qualitatively the same when estimated using the share of household members working off farm. However, market access does seem to impact land allocation within agriculture in favor of food production. Estimated land-use choice determinants in Vietnam (World Bank 2019) show remote households are more inclined to use a higher share of their land to grow rice and maize than perennial or industrial crops, even in areas where the land is more appropriate for perennial and industrial crops. Compared with the national average, households located approximately 15 km away (equivalent to two standard deviations) from an all-weather commune road devote 16 percent less land to industrial-crop production. The supply response of perennial and industrial crops to relative rice prices is also low, suggesting that while households prefer to diversify their livelihoods into non- farming activities, isolated households will prioritize agricultural activities toward food production. The result creates a low-level subsistence equilibrium, biased toward rice and cereals, which disincentivizes a production shift to higher-value and more agronomically suitable perennial crops. Market access and wage variation The positive correlation between market access and spatial wage variation in Vietnam is consistent with the hypothesis that firms in locations with higher market access pay lower transportation costs, which in turn allows them to pay higher wages. However, other potential alternative mechanisms rely on agglomeration economics to explain the observed impact of market access on wages. These alternative mechanisms include (a) potentially high cost of living in agglomeration centers inducing firms to raise nominal wages (Dekle and Eaton 1999), (b) increasing returns for firms due"

To isolate the impact of market access via the transport cost mechanism in Vietnam, the spatial variation in individual hourly wages is analyzed, accounting for skills, local population density, the cost of living, occupation, industry of employment, and firm ownership type. 97 Chapter 4: Delivering on \u201cLast-Mile\u201d InclusionEmpirical estimates from this analysis show a positive correlation between market access and individual wage variations in Vietnam, most significantly for foreign owned enterprise workers. A one standard deviation increase in market access associates with 11.5 percent higher hourly wages, after controlling for individual education and experience as well as job characteristics (occupation, industry, and provincial fixed effects). The estimate for employees in the domestic private sector is less robust, with wages increasing an estimated 3 percent (for a one standard deviation in market access) without accounting for provincial fixed effects, but show no increase when controlling for provincial fixed effects. However, public sector employees (including state-owned enterprise, or SOEs) are paid more when working in locations with poor market access, consistent with additional allowances for government employees in hard-to-reach areas. Thus, market access appears to account for the variation in wages, predominantly among the FDI sector. The evidence suggests other mechanisms linked to agglomeration significantly account for wage variation. That the impact of market access on domestic private sector wages is insignificant when controlling for provincial fixed effects suggests location specific non-human endowment factors contribute to the spatial variation in wages. The significance of the share of employees with post-secondary education points to the influence of skills sorting, while the significance of median housing values per square meter is consistent with Dekle and Eaton\u2019s postulation (1999) that a"

Over the period from 2009 to 2017, transport costs to reach an international gateway reduced significantly, giving rise to economic gains. Results from a general equilibrium model to evaluate transport interventions (see appendix A for the methodology) provides that\u2014keeping all other factors equal\u2014if the transport network had not changed between 2009 and 2017, income would have been 2.43 percent lower due to less international integration (table 4.5). National welfare, which encompasses benefits other than income, would also have been 3 percent lower. Estimates show these previous investments between 2009 and 2017 have decreased spatial real income inequality and helped spread international integration gains across the territory; the effects heightened when assuming no barriers to labor mobility. Investments under Scenario 1, through connectivity upgrades in remote localities and nearby border gates, would expand opportunities for international trade, thus improving national income while reducing spatial inequality. In an economy where the domestic labor is not mobile, estimates place the increase at 0.2 percent; when assuming no constraint on domestic labor mobility the increase would be lower at less than 0.1 percent, as the relative gain from improved connectivity is lower based on an already mobile domestic labor market. Investments under Scenario 1 would lower spatial inequality of welfare, that is, would support inclusiveness, both with or without mobile labor markets; the decrease would be steeper without barriers to labor mobility (table 4.6).TABLE 4.5.

Investments under Scenario 2 (table 4.7) could potentially grow income by 0.12 percent. However, gains from investments in the North\u2013South Expressway become much larger when workers can easily move toward more attractive regions. High mobility costs would prevent many workers from going toward locations that have benefited the most from better access to international gateways and global markets. Thus, if more workers had relocated over the past decade, the gains from transport investments would have been larger. Under Scenario 2, investments in major economic corridors to connect already established cities would worsen the spatial inequality, if workers cannot relocate freely, as shown in table 4.7. Benefits of better connectivity toward global markets would be enjoyed mostly by localities along the corridor. However, by removing barriers to labor mobility, investments that focus on main economic corridors could reduce spatial inequality and contribute to the inclusive growth. In sum, improvements in connectivity would generate positive impacts on national income, but investment impacts on spatial welfare inequality would depend on the degree of labor mobility barriers. This applies both to the actual transport investments and future scenarios of two very different types of investments\u2014scattered and remote area-focused investments versus those concentrated along a major economic corridor.

Generally remote and sparsely populated, the local economies in lagging areas of Vietnam depend mostly on external demand to generate growth and expand access to jobs; therefore, market access is crucial to improving economic opportunities in lagging regions. \u2022 Estimates show improving market access helps mitigate the disadvantage of remoteness and low density in Vietnam\u2019s lagging regions.

Improved market access also positively associates with households allocating more agriculture land to non-cereal crops better suited for their land. Enhanced market access also helps married women access paid work more than it does their husbands, which could help close the gender gap in participation in paid work. \u2022 The analysis modeled two future transport investment scenarios for their possible impacts on income and welfare increase, based on the Government of Vietnam\u2019s announced plans, namely on the North\u2013South Expressway and rehabilitation and upgrading of the national highway system. \u2022 The analysis shows these future investments would increase the welfare and income at all communes; however, increases would be highly uneven.

The method divides the mean outcome differential between two groups into a part \u201cexplained\u201d by group differences in endowment characteristics\u2014such as education or work experience\u2014and a residual part that cannot be accounted for by such differences in outcome determinants. The \u201cunexplained\u201d part is often used as a measure for discrimination as well as of the effects of group differential in unobserved variables.

Therefore, it is important to ensure Vietnam\u2019s infrastructure connectivity is resilient against future climate-induced risks. This chapter provides analytical evidence of increasing risks, while also identifying investments and measures to address these risks. 107 Chapter 5: Building ResilienceResilience and Reliability of Connectivity Vietnam\u2019s extensive transport network is exposed to various hazards, including landslide, fluvial (river) flooding, typhoon and flash flooding, all of which are increasing in intensity and frequency due to climate change (figure 5.1). With two or more natural disaster multihazard events per year, Vietnam ranks high as a natural disaster hotspot, with 60 percent of its land area and 71 percent population exposed to risk (Dilley and others 2005), which could result in annual average asset losses amounting to 1.5 percent of GDP and loss in consumption amounting to 2 percent of GDP (Hallegatte and others 2016). Extreme hazards are expected to intensify with climate change. It is possible that climate change will exacerbate these extreme hazards, even after factoring uncertainties in downscaled global climate model predictions (Irish Aid 2017; MoNRE 2009; World Bank 2011). Examining the spatial patterns of the hazard exposures for nationally important transport networks can offer additional insights.

Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the length of exposed highway would increase to 197 km by 2025 and to 222 km by 2050; under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the exposure length increases to 211 km in 2025 and to 235 km in 2050.2 Under the future RCP4.5 scenario, approximately 720 km to 1,163 km of the national road network would be exposed to extreme river flooding (flooding depth exceeding 1 meter) in the current flooding scenarios; the network exposure lengths would increase to between 786 km and 1,180 km. Similar estimates apply to the railway network, which often runs parallel to primary road network (Oh and others 2019). 108 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for Growth and Shared ProsperityFIGURE 5.1.

Key sea, air, and river ports in Vietnam are similarly exposed to natural hazards and to the risks of major flow disruption, with extreme intensity events becoming more frequent due to climate change. For example, the maximum hazard probability of the Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) seaport complex flooding increases five-folds, from the current 0.04 (1-in-25 years flooding) without climate change to 0.2 (1-in-5 years flooding) under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The analysis observes similar trends for all major ports including Haiphong port; combined, these trends could translate into a disruption of 68,000 to 106,000 tons of cargo flows per day and would result in significant economic loss to Vietnam.

The expected potential economic impacts of disruptions caused by natural hazards could be significant, accounting for increases in transport rerouting costs and production reductions due to input\u2013output links of goods moved on the affected transport link. The expected economic losses in case of various natural hazards can be calculated using a spatial analytical tool; figure 5.2 illustrates the example for the road network. Some transport links, which carry significant traffic yet have few rerouting options, could incur substantial economic loss, with estimates as high as US$20 million. The analysis shows risks along key sections of the QL1A trans-Vietnam highway are predominantly driven by landslides and typhoon flooding, while river flooding affects links around HCMC and Thua Then Hue, while flashfloods affect some mountain provinces due to the underlying hazards concentrated only in those regions.

For a large part of both the road and railway networks, the risks would increase more than 40 percent in the future hazard scenario (RCP 4.5) in 2030. The increase supports a strong case to build resilience into transport connectivity against future climate hazards. Risk and Criticality-Based Adaptation Strategy With the increasing intensity and frequency of natural hazards, it is imperative to improve the resilience of transport network as a strategy to support connectivity. A sound resilience strategy is multidisciplinary and should encompass: (a) good spatial planning of infrastructure based on economic activities and risks, (b) adequate technical standards commensurate with the risk level, (c) good construction quality and proactive maintenance of built assets, and (d) FIGURE 5.3.

In addition to the above broader resilience strategy, for the already-built infrastructure, it is important to identify any investments required for rehabilitation, reconstruction, or other engineering solutions needed to mitigate the risks. In the above-referenced World Bank study (Oh and others 2019), the economic costs and benefits have been analyzed for selected engineering solutions commonly used in Vietnam, against the key infrastructure failure cases, such as erosion of pavement or slope, drainage failure, or structural failure (for example, collapse of bridges and culverts). Compared to the existing cost norms and standards, the cost estimates for some of the engineering solutions to \u201cclimate-proof\u201d critical infrastructure could be as much as three times higher than their alternatives, depending on the structure, terrains, and the significance of risk exposure (table 5.1). Investments to upgrade or rehabilitate existing infrastructure would enhance its resilience and help avoid the estimated economic losses. The economic benefits of such investments represent the sum of the avoided annual expected rehabilitation costs for individual road links as well as the avoided expected annual economic losses (EAEL) from disruptions of transport freight flows caused by failures of individual road links, over an analysis period. The results suggest significant benefits of investing into building resilience, particularly along the expressway sections toward the eastern coastline. The benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) of adaptation can then be estimated for all identified road links, comparing the cost of adaptation investments and their economic benefits. The above analysis suggests climate-resilient designs could increase the cost of construction significantly; however, the high"

Based on the risk analysis presented in figure 5.2, the benefits and benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) of total climate-resilient investments have been calculated for each transport section. The results, presented in figure 5.4, suggests that investments to improve resilience would be economically justified (that is, yielding a BCR greater than 1) for about 20 percent of the transport network, compared to 10 percent without considering the future impacts of climate change. This provides a strong justification for upfront investments\u2014based on the criticality and risk exposure of transport links\u2014against the future natural hazards, which aggravate due to the climate change.TABLE 5.1.

Greater use of IWT could be encouraged by promoting \u201ccontainer-on-barge\u201d services, which would bring added flexibility for IWT and better compete with trucking. The lack of containerization has resulted in IWT becoming dominated by bulk commodities such as coal, construction materials, fertilizers, and cement. Other major road freight commodities could also potentially be containerized and transported through IWT. Rice offers an example of a commodity with significant potential for containerization; currently, only 4 percent of rice production in the Mekong Delta region is containerized. Among other benefits, containerization brings efficiency gains by facilitating faster transshipment. Recent successful examples in the Mekong Delta region suggest potential for cost reduction through containerization and a shift from road to IWT.3 Well-connected and well-equipped river ports comprise another critical missing link in Vietnam for intermodal connectivity between road and IWT. As discussed in chapter 1, many of the existing river ports are old, poorly-equipped\u2014generally without container-handling facilities\u2014 and poorly-connected to the road network. This aging port infrastructure has discouraged intermodal connections between road and IWT, while also restricting the use of IWT to a few routes connected mostly through waterborne transport. While additional investments in river ports are needed, most of which would be invested in and managed by private entities, two barriers prevent such investments: \u2022 Without public investments to"

Both barriers suggest the need for strong port development coordination between private port operators and provincial or city governments, perhaps warranting a joint development. The potential for domestic coastal, short-sea shipping in Vietnam has not been fully explored. Domestic cargo transportation through coastal shipping accounts for only 39 percent of the total coastal cargo throughput, in part due to the absence of a robust supply ecosystem as well as infrastructural constraints in and around the ports. On the supply side, very few shipping services offer coastal shipping, passing the additional costs, terminal handling charges, for example\u2014 which account for 50 percent of the total coastal shipping costs\u2014along to the client. Currently, terminal handling charges are uniform for both international and domestic cargo. However, ports have traditionally preferred international cargo over domestic cargo, in terms of turnaround time and berth allocation. On the infrastructural end, while the major export\u2013import oriented ports are being updated with the latest cargo-handling facilities, additional policy support could be used to promote Roll-on/Roll-off (RO\u2013RO) vessels with built-in or shore-based ramps. This would enable loaded trucks to roll directly onto ships, transfer through the sea, and then roll off from the ships to the ports. These trucks can then directly proceed to delivery, reducing dependencies on port handling services and dedicated short-haul truck services. At present, RO\u2013RO ships account for 0.04 percent of the cargo throughput from the HCMC port (JICA 2010). 115 Chapter 5: Building ResilienceCHAPTER SUMMARY \u2022 Vietnam is among the countries most"

The Government alone cannot plan or predict commercial decisions made by firms, investors, and individual consumers, decisions that affect formation of economic densities and connectivity in between. Thus, it is critical for the Government to enable, facilitate, and incentivize other decision makers, with an aim to shape the future of connectivity. 119 Chapter 6: RecommendationsFor Integration with Global Markets Recommendation 1: Re-orient transport and spatial planning to support critical value chains The nine most export-critical sectors analyzed in this report account for more than 70 percent of Vietnam\u2019s total export and cover industries where Vietnam has comparative advantages in terms of natural endowment, low cost labor, skilled labor, open trade relationships with its partners, among other aspects. As presented in chapter 2 of this report, the key sectors\u2019 value chain linkages, covering participating localities and economic clusters that provide inputs or consume final products, can be identified using various economic statistics and mapped on the transport network. Based on this analysis, we recommend that transport planning and investment strategies be informed by this type of spatial analysis, to promote a robust, trade-oriented connectivity policies and investments. At present, the objectives of enhancing trade competitiveness are not explicitly linked with the objectives of improving connectivity. Trade information, especially on value chains, is rarely used in policy formulation. In addition, a lack of in-depth analyses remains on spatial structure and connective propensity along various linked segments of value chains to inform relevant policies and investment for transport infrastructure development. Mainstreaming such an analytical approach for future decision making, beyond what was carried out for this report, first requires creating the entire trade- and transport-link ecosystem.

The ongoing efforts by the Ministry of Transport (MoT) to establish the Vietnam Logistics Statistical System is an important step in the right direction.

However, some gateways are situated within built-up urban areas with limited expansion possibilities. The Government of Vietnam has long recognized this issue and plans to build new gateways, such as the planned airport in Long Thanh, that would share the increasing air traffic volume with the existing inner-city airport at Tan Son Nhat. Some major international gateways face serious issues concerning inland connectivity. Existing road corridors often go through the inner city, aggravating congestion with a mix of truck traffic traveling to ports and commuter motorbikes. Several maritime ports have insufficient capacity to handle inland waterway barges, which often provide gateways with critical inland connectivity. Such situations are caused in part by the lack of coordination around development of international gateways and their connectivity; the former is driven by the national government, while the latter is provided by provincial or city authorities, with unmatched budgeting priorities and timeframes. The case of Vung Tau seaport complex, which is built to handle large intercontinental ships but poorly connected both by road and inland waterway, serves as an example. We therefore recommend coordinating transport planning with the explicit objective of strengthening multimodal and intermodal connectivity, strongly emphasizing critical chokepoints and hinterland connectivity around the key gateways. Changes in product-based export structure should also be required priorities when building better logistics and connectivity for higher-value product exports. A transport system aiming to promote export should thus consider this shift of logistics perspectives, especially with regard to prioritizing investment into appropriate types of trade gateways. Therefore, future policy and investment strategies around international trade gateways should be informed not only by trade growth, but also (and more importantly) by the"

Travel speed on new expressways is two-to-three times faster than the existing road network, resulting in significant reduction in economic distances. On the other hand, Vietnam has seen a proliferation of various economic clusters, such as industrial parks (IP) and economic zones (EZ). While they once might have been primarily driven by provincial-level initiatives and private sector investment, these economic clusters are no longer singular manufacturing enclaves, but rather nodes in a larger industrial\u2014and well-connected\u2014ecosystem. While many clusters have chosen to locate along the existing major transport corridors connecting major cities and/or international gateways, some existing clusters have reached a point where further agglomeration and concentration would result in lower return because of congestion\u2014and possibly also rent increase.

The rapid expansion the transport produces an urgency and strong need for proactive spatial planning around transport corridor development and economic clustering. We are not recommending the Government select sites and carry out IP projects; the private sector can make locational choices based on their business needs and commercial considerations. Instead, we recommend prudent and no-regret planning decisions to encourage efficient use of future high-value transport nodes created alongside the newly developing connective infrastructure, such as North\u2013South Expressway.

While the private sector will play a critical role in FDI sector development, the Government could provide support by creating an enabling regulatory environment, enforcing standards, and \u201cnudging\u201d consumers to support a competitive market. In chapter 3, we explored the example of perishable food. Considering the vast negative economic, environmental, and public health consequences of unsafe perishable food, Vietnam needs to upgrade the quality and safety of food production, transportation, and distribution. Notwithstanding the food safety laws and regulations already in place, monitoring and enforcement is extremely resource-intensive because of food chain fragmentation. For more effective regulation around food chain, Vietnam should strengthen the interagency coordination and introduce a risk-based approach. Involving both national and local authorities, regulatory and enforcement coordination is essential between the food certification system and production, sourcing, and transportation and distribution of food. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has appropriately moved to focus oversight efforts on a risk-based approach, in order to prioritize various enterprises and product lines. However, Vietnam cannot police its way to safe and sustainable value chains for perishable foods. The lack of demand for certified food and a refrigerated food chain is not rooted in the lack of demand for safety and quality, but rather in the lack of awareness and knowledge around the certification system, which leads to persistent consumer preference for traditional wet markets. Maintaining unbroken cold chains entails additional costs to the food logistics, and many consumers doubt the resultant price premium is worthwhile. Therefore, greater attention needs to be given to raising awareness and knowledge about safe and unsafe practices and building programs which facilitate"

International experiences suggest financial incentives encourage investments to expand the scale of truck operations, conditioned on the continued growth of the borrower. Such an approach, known as a \u201cgrowth-based lending scheme,\u201d would give smaller operators access to cheaper loans with which they can upgrade their fleet and grow their business.

This goes beyond the food chain to the broader consumption sector, particularly in urban areas. Currently, with few exceptions, matters of needs, risk, and performance of food system and other urban consumption activities are not mainstreamed into urban land-use planning, logistics, environmental management, or overall municipal governance. Most agricultural strategies and plans identify cities as end points for consumption, but not as active, responsible players in governance of supply chains including for food. As a result, while many cities increasingly recognize the above noted problems, most responses have been modest, piecemeal, and reactive, and therefore thoroughly inadequate. Instead of this \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach, cities should adopt a paradigm shift, which involves integrated strategies for promoting resilient, inclusive, competitive, and environmentally sustainable urban supply chain and market infrastructure. In major urban areas, current practices in transport planning focuses on transport infrastructure, such as the city\u2019s road network, bridges, urban railways, and public transport systems, omitting consideration for urban logistics.

By examining the relationship between the transport network changes from 2009 to 2017 and the socioeconomic characteristics of all communes, we found that the significant improvements in transport connectivity during the period led to wage and welfare increases across the country. However, communes have experienced a highly uneven magnitude of these benefits, depending on the commune\u2019s economic distance to economic opportunities. When we analyzed the counterfactual of population and welfare gains at the commune level without transport network improvement, we found that transport connectivity has slowed down the concentration of economic activities in the two major cities, Hanoi and HCMC.

Our analysis showed the welfare gains from improved connectivity will be greater with no constraints to labor mobility. By facilitating the free movement of people to locations offering opportunities for better jobs and higher wages, in part thanks to their better connectivity, the economy as a whole can maximize the benefits of improved connectivity. At household levels, while we found good market access strongly correlated with positive economic outcomes, this explains only around 30 to 34 percent of gaps in off-farm employment across geographical locations and ethnicities. The remaining gaps are explained by other factors, such as education attainment and agriculture-related endowments and"

Our analysis estimated the substantial economic loss caused on connective infrastructures by natural hazards, considering not only damage recovery costs, but economy-wide impacts on value chains from flow disruptions. Some critical transport links located along coastal lines, mountainous areas, or flood-prone terrains are highly vulnerable to various climatic events. Significant upfront investments are therefore justified to strengthen their resilience and reduce their vulnerability; even greater investments are justified under future climate change scenarios, which show the increasing likelihood of extreme events.

Our in-depth analysis combining multiple layers of geospatial information supports this argument: even a modest modal shift from road to waterborne transport, which would be economically beneficial given the lower transport costs of the latter, would reduce risk exposure and improve resilience of the overall transport network. In reality, however, achieving multimodality is a challenging and complex undertaking that requires infrastructure development, a regulatory framework, market incentives, and overcoming inertia. We argue that the most critical barriers to multimodality include the lack of inland waterway transport containerization combined with the lack of well-connected and well-equipped river ports to facilitate transshipment and handling of container-on-barge cargo, along with the underutilized potential for domestic coastal shipping. Vietnam could unleash the further potential for inland waterway transport through containerization. While private sector players such as shippers and LSPs would make the necessary investments in containerization, by creating a conducive environment through an improved waterway infrastructure, the Government would provide a consistent capacity to handle large vessels, thereby supporting safe navigation via a vessel traffic management system, and enhancing hinterland connectivity of river ports in key locations. Specifically, the municipal or provincial government could play a more active role in port development through adoption of a landlord port model, leading to joint development agreements between private port operators and provincial or city governments. These subnational governments have a legal responsibility to purse national goals in IWT development and would acquire a strong interest in the flow-through economic benefits successful port activity could bring. Under such a model, the public sector (local governments) would fund, fully or partly, investments in the port substructure (such as approach channels, quay walls, and berth depth) and road connectivity to main highways and make land available for expansion."

Following this approach, the analysis consists of four integral steps as summarized in figure A.1. Hierarchical structure of a value chain is defined on input\u2013output linkages and spatial industrial concentration of all segments. Selecting key value chains The first step is to analytically identify key value chains for this study where Vietnam is already competitive. Four sets of criteria for identifying key value chains include: (a) high trade performance and high importance in the economy; (b) high comparative advantage; (c) high value added and potential for job creation; and (d) in line with the Government\u2019s priority. Identifying value chain linkages The purpose of the second step is to determine the production structure of domestic value chains comprising the identified key value chains by analyzing domestic input\u2013output linkages. The value chain linkages are identified following four key steps: (a) determine first tier supplying sectors (sectors\u2019 backward linkages) using data from Vietnam\u2019s input\u2013output tables for 2011 and 2016; (b) repeat the exercise in the first step multiple times to compute second-, third- or higher tier supplying sectors; (c) create diagrams of value chain linkages; and (d) refine linkages and diagrams based on expert views and sectoral data. The first step, determining first-tier supplying sectors, is based on a sector\u2019s"

The third step is to develop a diagram of value chain linkages for each of the key value chain sectors as well as the first, second, and third tier supplying sectors. The information from the input\u2013output analysis is refined in the fourth step in combination with external information from existing value chain maps or clusters. This allows us to create value-chain specific concordance tables that link the sectors of the input\u2013output tables to the Vietnam Standard Industrial Classification (VSIC) codes. Note that these concordance tables are value chain specific, as the input\u2013output tables are much more aggregated than the 5-digit VSIC codes (138 sectors vs. 734 sectors), that is, an I/O sector can be linked to different VSIC codes. VSIC is crucial to ensure accurate reference of value chain structure and reliable source of analytical data. Defining spatial structure of value chains The third step is to use the analytical results of the above analysis on input\u2013output linkages of the domestic value chains to determine their spatial structure. In other words, the main purpose of this step is to determine geographical distribution and industrial concentration of selected chains, including the backward segments of the value chain. Spatial structure of value chains is defined as the concentration of employment in each segment of a given value chain. Value chain-based connective propensity and key corridors A connective propensity for a value chain is defined as the trend of related commodities flowing from and to international gateways and along various productive points of a domestic value chain, as shown in the connective model in figure A.2. A connective propensity is defined based on spatial locations of different productive segments of the domestic value chain and the structure of value chain linkages.

In this model, an import\u2013export gateway lies at the end of the nodes. For all identified value chains, trade gateways\u2014air, sea, inland waterways, rail and road\u2014are origins of imports and destinations of exports, while in contrast, the location of cluster segments (suppliers and processors) is the internal export origin and import destination. The information on trade gateways and border gates in all transport forms are important for value-chain based connectivity. This analytical step should be completed by a modeling of the value chain linkage as a result of the previous study. This will simulate the freight flows in accordance with origin\u2013destination model along the spatial organization of value chains and connects chains to main international gateways. The mapping results allowed to identify trade corridors organized to promote value chain linkages, and to evaluate supporting logistics services to improve overall efficiency as well as the competitiveness of selected value chains. An important step involves developing a model of disaggregated freight flows for traffic between the main freight centers in Vietnam (at district level if possible, including cluster locations) and the country\u2019s trade gateways. The freight flows modeling, however, requires data concerning the volume of freights for input\u2013output transportation within a value chain and between processor location and border gate. Given the lack of readily accessible volume data required for relevant freight flows, available trade HS value data should be converted into equivalent freight volume data.

We found two limitations in this analysis. The first limitation relates to the internal validity of the probit estimates. Given that the purpose of this analysis is to document the correlates of non-agricultural wage employment at various levels, we assume that the individual random effects are uncorrelated with Ai, Bh, Fh, Mna, and Ma. To the extent that this assumption is violated, we have limited internal validity of the estimates. Panel data strategies, such as fixed-effects models, can potentially control for this endogeneity. However, the rotating panels of Vietnam Household Living Standards Surveys (VHLSSs) conducted by the General Statistics Office (GSO) in previous years (2012 and 2014) result in small samples that do not provide enough statistical power to estimate the multivariate probit model. The second limitation concerns the external validity due to sample selection. To estimate the multivariate probit model, we need to select the households that have at least one co-residing, working-age child. However, living arrangement is not random. If the unobserved household-specific variables that determine living arrangement also affect non-agricultural wage employment, then we have restricted external validity to apply the results from this analysis to the rest of rural Vietnamese households. We solve this by estimating a household and spouse model, which covers a broader set of households. The findings are qualitatively similar.

Market access and spatial wage differences Most of the empirical analysis of the relationship between market access and the spatial variation in wages estimate the relationship using regional average wages instead of individual wages. In this study, we follow Hering and Poncet (2010) to estimate the relationship between market access and wage variation, controlling for individual characteristics such as education, which is an important determinant of earnings. This is particularly important in the context of Vietnam where lagging regions have a higher share of less educated people when compared to the country\u2019s agglomeration centers. A typical Mincerian earnings regression is estimated with individual hourly wages as the dependent variable. The analysis is done with the VHLSS 2016 data, using observations in both rural and urban areas. The new economic geography literature emphasizes that lower transportation costs faced by firms in locations with higher market access allows these firms to pay higher wages, thus explaining the positive relationship between market access and higher wages. Since market access is linked to agglomeration, others have proposed alternative mechanisms relying on agglomeration economics 139 Appendix Ato explain the observed impact of market access on wages.

To distinguish the impact of market access through the transportation costs links, the model estimates controls for (a) the skill intensity of each location using the share of people with post-secondary education, (b) land values and the local population density to capture the impact of agglomeration on the cost of living (housing, transportation costs, and congestion), and (c) provincial fixed effects to control for non-human factor endowments.

These models incorporate features of the data, such as large numbers of locations with heterogeneous geography, productivity, amenities, and local factors as well as trade and commuting costs. They are also able to include interactions between locations, such as trade in goods and migration. These models can be used to evaluate policies and counterfactual scenarios and to set apart the contribution of transport improvements versus other changes that affect wages and population across locations. The models have three main building blocks: \u2022 Geography. The model allows for spatial granularity at the district level considering the 683 districts of Vietnam. Each district is characterized by its location, land area, livability, economic structure, and firm productivity. Livability captures the quality of life in a district, which is determined by factors such as the quality of education and health services that influence people\u2019s choices on where to live. \u2022 Economic activity.

        "text": "live. All workers derive their income from employment and spend it on goods and services produced locally or imported from the rest of the world. Workers\u2019 decisions on where to live and where to work depend on rents, wages, and livability across districts. Using population, land, and transport data for 2009 and 1017, district productivities and amenities are calibrated to make counterfactual predictions. The information required to calibrate the model is similar to the one used in the calculation of market access and comes from traditional data sources, such as surveys and from geo-coded information on the transport network. The calibration process relies on observed variables\u2014size of land, employment per sector (second model) or wage (first model), and population density) to induce some key parameters that will encompass the unobserved characteristics of each district. Although productivity and livability scores at the district level are not observed, the model is used to infer these scores based on the observed levels of the size and composition of land, employment per sector, and population density. Productivity scores reflect the potential of firms to produce using labor and land inputs. While workers and land are similar across districts, the capacity of firms to produce differ across locations. Livability scores reflect the potential of a district in terms of amenity and affect the residential choice of workers. Workers tend to move toward districts offering higher real wages and higher amenity levels. Data used to calibrate include land areas (European Space Agency land categories from the Aiddata database (http://www.aiddata.org), the current distribution of population per district from census data for 2010 and 2015, and employment and wage categories from the MTI survey datafound in unpublished survey data provided by the World Bank\u2019s Macroeconomics, Trade, and Investment Global Practice. 144 Vietnam Development Report 2019: Connecting Vietnam for"

        "text": "Growth and Shared ProsperityModel used to produce counterfactuals for domestic connectivity Based on Redding (2016), the model can be used to undertake counterfactuals using only data in an initial equilibrium. In the counterfactuals, the welfare gains from trade depend on changes in both domestic trade shares and reallocations of population across locations. The model has constant returns to scale, with all districts potentially trading with one other. Some locations experience larger reductions in trade costs than others, and population reallocates to these locations and away from other locations until the price of the immobile factor of production land adjusts. However, some differences remain in real wages across districts. Model used to produce counterfactuals for international connectivity The spatial general equilibrium model for Vietnam assesses the effects of improved internal transport costs on the integration of districts with global markets. The model looks at how reductions in transport costs affect the competitiveness of districts in the production of imports and exports\u2014that is, tradeable goods. The model relies on previous work done for Bangladesh,1 Argentina (Fajgelbaum and Redding 2018) and for the Belt and Road Initiative in Central Asia (Lall and Lebrand 2019). Similar to the previous section, the model has three main building blocks\u2014geography, economic activity, and workers\u2014which are connected by goods prices, land rents, and wages that prevail in each district.

The facility has a capacity of 1,500 palettes, located on an area of 6,000 square meters, in which the area for storage, loading, and unloading accounts for 2,500 square meters. It is a part of the fruit transformation factory on an area of 16,000sq.m in the Mekong Delta town. Andros opens cold storage facility in Tien Giang Inside Go Cong's Fruit Transformation Factory of Andros Asia \u201cVietnamese fruits have great advantages regarding diverse varieties, material fruit regions with fertile soil, and favourable climate for fruit growing. We hope to combine them with our expertise in fruit sourcing and agri-tech services in order to deliver high-value products\u201d, said Valentin Tran, general manager of Andros Asia. The cold storage facility boasts two major advantages. Firstly, it is near the production area so that it can help to reduce transportation costs and ensure the quality of harvested fruits. Secondly, it offers ease in the arrangement to order, import, and export goods. Andros opens cold storage facility in Tien Giang Andros Asia was established six years ago after the acquisition of Hung Phat Fruits Producing Co., Ltd. Its approach is to cooperate with provinces to establish material fruit regions, aiming at sustainable mutual development and yielding high economic benefits via the fruit manufacture and consumption chain. As a result, the company has transformed about 20.000 tonnes of fruits per year and exported more than 40.000 tonnes of to foreign markets. The firm also cooperated with provinces like Binh Thuan to achieve the Global G.A.P certificate for red dragon fruits."

Tran said that the company targets to transform 20,000 tonnes of fruits into 10,000 tonnes of the final product by the end of this year. So far, the company has two factories in Go Cong and My Tho, both in Tien Giang province, with the capacity to produce around 22,000 tonnes of finished products per year. Key buyers from Andros Asia are Vinamilk, Phuc Long, The Coffee House, and hotel, restaurant, and catering companies. In Tien Giang, Andros Asia collaborates with the local authorities to build a pink guava region on 5 hectares this year. Meanwhile, another region for high-quality acerola cherries is also going to be established to meet the strict import requirements of markets like Europe and the US. The company will also work with local partners to make a list of potential fruit regions and build action plans for these."

Indonesia telah digambarkan sebagai pasar yang rumit bagi produsen dan distributor asing untuk mempertahankan keuntungan, karena geografi dan kurangnya kemampuan infrastruktur. Ada 6.000 pulau berpenghuni di Indonesia yang mencakup 5.000 km dari timur ke barat, sehingga sulit untuk secara efisien dan cepat mengangkut, menyimpan dan mendistribusikan produk-produk suhu \u2013 sensitif. Bahkan konsumen di pulau Jawa, yang merupakan rumah bagi sebagian besar penduduk Indonesia, sulit dijangkau karena pembelinya tersebar di seluruh nusantara. Mayoritas daerah terpencil di Indonesia kekurangan pasokan daya listrik, yang menimbulkan hambatan yang signifikan pada pengembangan rantai pendingin.

Ada sumber daya alam yang melimpah, namun, infrastrukturnya sangat terbatas untuk dapat mengeksploitasi secara efisien.
